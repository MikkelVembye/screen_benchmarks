AB  - The article presents information on the importance of the culture of reading in a public school. The aim of introducing the culture was to describe the integrated pattern of reading behavior, practices, beliefs, and knowledge, and to understand how the staff and students actively created and maintained this pattern. There was the need to examine the physical space, the shared activities, and the individual behaviors and beliefs of the participants as they related to reading. The ultimate goal was to describe these features and examine how they varied, and specifically to see how gender operated as a variable. INSET: Service-learning and Ethnography.

AB  - For the past two years, eighth graders at Lincoln Middle School have been participating in the STEMester of Service program, which uses the science, math, and language arts curricula to help students improve the environment. More than 70% of Lincoln students receive free and reduced-price lunch, and the school is diverse because it hosts the district's newcomer and international student program. A structured semester of service learning provides teacher preparation and support. Students work across disciplines to identify and contribute to solutions for a local environmental problem. Through the STEMester of Service, students, teachers, and community partners implement high-quality service learning not only to "green" their schools and communities but also to increase student engagement and achievement. Teachers encourage students' interest in their communities by giving them a voice and teaching them how they can make a difference. And as a result of their study and service, students develop their leadership and academic skills.

AB  - Short-term and 1-year effects of the Learn and Serve America program were examined in an evaluation of programs at 17 middle schools and high schools nationwide. The following four data sources were among those analyzed: survey responses and school records of approximately 1,000 Learn and Serve program participants and comparison group members; surveys of teachers at the 17 schools; telephone interviews with staff at participating community agencies; and on-site interviews and observation of program activities. Together, students at the 17 sites participated in more than 300 projects each semester and provided more than 150,000 hours of service during the program year. Although the Learn and Serve programs had a positive short-term effect on participants' civic attitudes and involvement in volunteer service at the end of the program year, they showed little evidence of longer-term impacts at the 1-year follow-up. The effects of service learning on academic performance were significantly greater among nonwhite and educationally disadvantaged participants. Despite strong administrator and teacher support for the program, few sites engaged in organized efforts to expand the use of service learning at either the school or school district levels. On average, program participants produced services valued at nearly four times the program's costs. (MN)

AB  - The Afterschool Alliance, in partnership with MetLife Foundation, is proud to present the third in a series of four issue briefs examining critical issues facing middle school youth and the vital role afterschool programs play in addressing these issues. This brief focuses on service-learning opportunities for middle schoolers. Pairing service with academic enrichment can support youth success in many ways. Middle schoolers in particular can benefit greatly from the improved self-confidence and learning gains afforded by service-learning opportunities. Afterschool programs interested in providing service-learning for students must be mindful of the important blend of providing community service opportunities along with an academic component. Whereas community service activities allow youth to develop and apply their skills and knowledge to real-life situations and enhance their ability to become productive, contributing adult citizens, including an academic component by allowing youth to lead the service project ties youth development goals to actual gains in the classroom. All of this leads to better students and a brighter future, and highlights an example of how afterschool benefits children, schools and their communities. (Contains 15 endnotes.)

AB  - Engagement among adolescents is a crucial factor for identity formation and positive youth development (Barker, 2015; Kegan, 1994). To help address disengagement, socially engaged art education (SEAE) practices have emerged, combining art with action-oriented curricula to critically examine the community and connect to it through meaningful experiences (Helguera, 2011). This current study aimed to better understand how the social dynamics at school and in the student’s own neighborhood impacted the roots of engagement, particularly from school and the larger community, and to address the need to understand interventions that engage, such as those led by art. To study youth engagement in the context of disenfranchised school environments, I designed a pragmatic informed participatory research study, which included six art-infused civic activities that incorporated reflection, action, and artful dialogue framed by Reason’s (1994) co-operative inquiry process. Through this research approach, I explored the perceptions that 16 12th-grade high school students had about their community and their desire to connect and to serve. Using an embedded mixed-methods design (Creswell, 2014), the art-infused civic activities and data collection took place simultaneously. The methods used included questionnaires and surveys, field observations, participant-produced documents, visual methods, interviews, and focus groups. An analysis of the data yielded several findings regarding the participants’ perceptions and connections to their community. For the participants in this study, community was the product of finding and discovering commonalities and feeling safe, as well as having opportunities to attain new skills. The students identified a lot of deficiencies at school, which led them to feel that school was not part of their community. However, despite this apathy, the students expressed appreciation for opportunities that allowed them to bond with their peers and teachers. Engagement in the art-infused civic activities resulted in students attaining newly formed perspectives about their peers and the school staff. The participants reported viewing them as having the capacity to show a caring side. Through these activities, they also saw themselves as more empathetic and able to make an impact in their community. Although some of the participants had been involved in service activities prior to this study, they felt that in this study the experiences were more meaningful because they were able to reflect and understand the magnitude of their contribution. Even though most participants expressed having a desire to help both their community and school, they also felt that this could not be accomplished until they became financially stable. This study contributes to the field of art education by examining the viability of art projects that aim to address youth disengagement, and to better understand the impact that art education has on youth engagement dynamics in the context of low-SES communities.

AB  - This study addresses the role of peer civic engagement during adolescence on political participation in adulthood. We focus on novel specification based on an alternative peer group: the coursework cluster, which is constructed using an algorithm based on course taking habits. This paper explores how peers within course-taking clusters affect future political participation. The civic identities and politically oriented norms developed may be passed on through these classmates. Our results show that the influence of the peer group is from peers who perform better (have a higher grade point average) in social studies courses and from peers who participate in extracurricular activities.

AB  - The environmental issues we face as individuals and as a society are pervasive and ingrained in our cultural ways of being so that we can no longer look to science and technology to solve these problems alone. Instead, educators have been charged with providing students with environmental education through community-based service learning and educational trips. This study investigated the effects of these two community-based instructional modes relative to traditional instruction and any moderating effect of school location on primary school pupils' environmental knowledge in Oyo Metropolis, Nigeria. The study adopted a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. The Environmental Knowledge Test was used to elicit responses from 264 primary-5 pupils across 12 schools. There was a significant main effect of instruction on pupils' environmental knowledge and significant interaction effect of treatment and school location. This suggests that curriculum developers and planners should promote service learning and educational trips for effective teaching and learning of social studies.

AB  - The focus of this program is on adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prevention. Originally implemented in two middle schools in Brooklyn, New York, in the mid-1990's, Reach for Health (RFH-CYS) is a service-learning intervention that combines community field placements with classroom health instruction to help middle school students develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills that will keep them safe and healthy. Through field placements in various health and social service settings, students have the opportunity to experience the sense of empowerment and accomplishment that comes from being asked to do something meaningful, and doing it well. Back in the classroom, they are provided with the information, skills, and support they need to reinforce their community service experiences through health instruction that focuses on reducing risks related to early and unprotected sex as well as other health-compromising behaviors. Several key features of RFH-CYS increase the likelihood of success and enhance ease of implementation: RFH-CYS is based on a theoretical model of behavior change; designed for diverse student audiences; and easily integrated into school health programs. Further, evaluation of RFH-CYS demonstrates that the program has a positive impact on reducing risky behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the historical perspective, components, and current research regarding the benefits of service-learning to students, the school, and the community. Specifically, the effects of one service-learning program on student grade point average and attendance were examined. This study utilized eight years of archival data from an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group was comprised of high school students who completed both years of a two-year course. The second year of this course was a service-learning class. A randomly selected equivalent control group was comprised of students who completed both years of a two-year course which had no service-learning class. An unpaired t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test were used. Because of the large number of subjects (698), a .01 level of significance was used. The data analysis showed that both the experimental group and the control group experienced increases in grade point average from one year to the next. However, the service-learning group had significantly greater increases in grade point average than the control group. Data analysis also revealed that both the experimental group and the control group had increases in absences from one year to the next. The experimental (service-learning) group had a significantly greater number of absences than the control group.

AB  - Controversial issues have been established within the larger framework of civic education as an effective pedagogical approach to developing critical thinking in the classroom, preparing students with intellectual habits necessary for participation in scholarship, civic life and democracy. In this study, we found that a pedagogical intervention, Teaching for Transformative Experience in History, in some cases led to significantly higher engagement with political concepts beyond the classroom, and in other cases, the intervention led to significantly improved conceptual change. The study addresses some of the challenges presented by the research on civic education, providing a potential framework for developing pedagogical practice in history and social studies education that grounds a participatory, meaning-making process in curriculum design and assessment framed by controversial issues.

AB  - Service learning programs are being advanced as effective vehicles for preparing young people for active citizenship and promoting growth in self-esteem, interpersonal skills, leadership skills, and personal responsibility. Although there is a burgeoning literatue addressing service learning programs in school subject areas such as language arts, math, science, and social studies, little consideration has been given to the potential of physical activity programs to provide meaningful service learning experiences for youngsters. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data, this article describes an apprentice teacher program in which a group of urban youngsters taught basketball to young children attending a summer sports camp. The apprentice teacher program captured the interests and talents of this group of young people who, in their school career, had been characterized as behavior problems, poor attenders, and low achievers. The experience improved their self-confidence, concern for others, intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for learning. The apprentice teachers completed the program aware of the contributions they could make toward helping others and eager to continue the work the following year.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore the possible influences of school restructuring and disability status on the development of the self-determination of high school students. Self-determination was measured by means of the four subscales on The Arc's Self-Determination Scale: Autonomy, Self-Regulation, Psychological Empowerment, and Self Realization. The perceptions of student with disabilities regarding school practices that enhance the development of self-determination were measured by means of a School Practices Inventory, developed specifically for this study. The sample consisted of 138 students with disabilities and 186 nondisabled students at three restructured and three corresponding non-restructured high schools in Arizona, New Hampshire, and New York. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant main effect of disability, with students with disabilities scoring lower on self-determination than their nondisabled peers. In addition, significant interaction effects were found between school restructuring and school location and between school restructuring, student disability status, and location. The significant interactions suggested that the effects of school restructuring on self-determination may depend on student disability status and on the specific practices used and the ways in which they are implemented in different schools. Student ratings of school practices that are typically associated with school restructuring suggested that students with disabilities generally regarded all of the practices as important to the development of self-determination. However, two of the highest rated practices were establishing strong and lasting relationships with other students and also with teachers. Additionally, several career development practices were ranked high, including finding adult mentors and role models, utilizing on-the-job training programs, and participating in internships, community based learning, or service learning activities. Further exploration is needed into the specific school practices that may enhance the development of the self-determination of adolescents with disabilities.

AB  - The Annenberg Rural Challenge locates and funds exemplary rural public school programs to serve as models for rural education reform. The guiding theory of the Rural Challenge is that when rural schools base their teaching on the economy, ecology, history, and culture of their communities while fully engaging the community in the school's work, schools and communities improve together. A 4-year evaluation of the effectiveness of the Rural Challenge's reform work concluded that: (1) place-based education increased student appreciation of their histories and communities and increased community participation and resources; (2) participation in community-based work instilled valuable new skills in addition to academic understanding; and (3) learning in the community involved demonstrating student leadership, responding to community needs, and contributing to community well-being, and changed expectations of what it means to attend school. Although standardized test results were not a factor in the evaluation, it was noted that Rural Challenge schools demonstrated above-average performance on traditional benchmarks of test scores, attendance, and graduation rates. Examples are given of student projects based on environmental issues, local history and culture, rural economic development, and technology. (TD)

In this series of exercises, students will learn about disaster myths by observing concrete examples, reflecting on them critically, and applying concepts to real world examples. By doing so, they obtain skills to assess and analyze myths about public behavior in the aftermath of a disaster.

AB  - This handbook was written to encourage and assist school districts, schools, and community-based organizations to respond to the growing need for adolescent pregnancy prevention activities in the middle grades. It reflects the experiences of adolescent pregnancy prevention programs across the country, particularly those of the eight Urban Middle Schools Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program projects. It describes many of the lessons learned in these projects about appealing to at-risk youth, overcoming the barriers to implementation, working collaboratively, and dealing with controversy. Part 1 looks at why adolescent pregnancy prevention should take place in the middle grades. Implications for risk prevention strategies are discussed. Changes are looked at for meeting developmental needs in middle grades education. Elements of an effective pregnancy prevention program are outlined, and collaboration is discussed as a means to better meet the needs of adolescents. Part 2 contains information about pregnancy prevention strategies, including family life and sexuality education, postponing sexual involvement, counseling, peer education, school-based clinics, service learning, mentoring, and multicomponent programs. Part 3 discusses program implementation and includes information about planning, handling controversy, promoting effective collaborations, staff development, funding, and evaluation. Appendices include a case study, a summary of evaluation of pregnancy prevention strategies, a summary of statistics on teenage sexuality and pregnancy, and a list of resource organizations. (LLL)

AB  - The teacher-researcher employed multiple methods in this action research to analyze the effects of service-learning on the self-efficacy for self-regulated learning of her third-grade music students as they participated in an intergenerational project—sharing music and writing with residents in a local nursing home. Quantitative data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests and regression analyses. The quantitative data included the results from the Children's Self-Efficacy Scale (Bandura, 2006) and progress rating scales administered by the teacher-researcher. Emergent coding of qualitative data revealed recurring themes derived from the following sources: observation and field notes, students’ reflective journals, student and teacher interviews, classroom artifacts, and informal discussions with the homeroom teacher. Qualitative results supported the findings of the quantitative analyses. The analyses revealed that the students who participated in a service-learning experience improved their self-efficacy ratings for self-regulated learning significantly more than the students who did not participate in service-learning during the three-month project.

AB  - Research on service-learning offers compelling evidence of the advances student learners make in moral development, orientation to prosocial behavior, and curricular content retention. But who are those student learners? Most studies focus on native, dominant-culture, dominant-language students serving marginalized populations. Studies of the United States, for example, primarily focus on English-speaking U.S. citizens serving either linguistically and culturally similar populations marked by economic, educational, or health vulnerabilities, or linguistically and culturally different populations to facilitate the acquisition of another language or cultural tradition, such as tutoring at a Latino community center in order to learn Spanish. Much less research has focused on English language learners as agents of service in the United States, volunteering at U.S. social service agencies in order to increase their own acquisition of the English language and U.S. culture. This study addresses that gap in the research by analyzing results of a language immersion program that aimed to develop multiple literacies in academic English through service-learning and community engagement. The study documents significant gains in intercultural awareness and advanced language acquisition over 8 weeks of service-learning, recommending service-learning as an exceptional pedagogical mechanism for domestic and international programs in intercultural development and second language acquisition.

AB  - Studies of service learning suggest that students and instructors believe it benefits students. Nevertheless, the literature is still lacking in methods for assessing the effectiveness of service learning. This research helps fill this gap by developing, validating, and evaluating a service learning survey for a marketing research course (the MR-SL scale). The survey captures four important dimensions for assessing perceived student learning and satisfaction, and assesses student learning more comprehensively than other service learning scales. The results demonstrate that students describe learning about marketing research, developing critical thinking skills, gaining value in working with others, and contributing to the community.

AB  - The Academy For Learning (AFL) serves urban students with emotional and behavioral problems. Through a Personal and Social Responsibility program, students develop skills for personal growth and service learning. Many alternative programs for troubled students offer little more than a curriculum for containment and control. In contrast, students at the Academy For Learning are empowered to serve as teachers and positive role models for younger peers at an area junior high school. This article describes the program as seen by school staff and from the perspectives of the students involved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the interdisciplinary (the disciplines of Turkish, Social Science, Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Public Administration) activities performed in the scope of the Community Service Practices Course on the air pollution awareness (APW). This study has been performed as a multiple case study. Participants consisted of 32 pre-service elementary school teachers and 122 elementary school students enrolled in a 4th grade. Data were collected using the Air Pollution Awareness Questionnaire, Know-Want-Learn forms and interviews. Content analysis was used for analysis of data. The APW of participants have increased. It has been determined that the pre-service elementary school teachers have evaluated the implementation as being generally successful. Also it has been seen that the implementation has served different purposes out of the study aim for the pre-service elementary school teachers like providing teaching experience and how to teach the interdisciplinary subjects.

AB  - The context of privilege provides unique opportunities and challenges for youth civic development. A mixed-method approach was used to examine links between school-based community service, school climate, and civic orientation among students in cultures of privilege. Surveys completed by students (N = 376) at two private high schools--one with an extracurricular community service requirement and one without--suggest that students in the school without the service requirement report similar, and in some cases more positive, civic attitudes than students from the school with the requirement. Focus-group data indicated that the service requirement was viewed positively, but illuminated other school experiences that might promote community orientation in cultures of privilege, such as an emphasis on global awareness and making civic priorities fundamental to school identity.

AB  - This study frames continued long-term participation in community engagement activities as indicative of a sense of ‘purpose’ as defined by Damon, Menon, and Cotton Bronk (2003). Using data from US-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined factors that predict whether students participating in civic engagement activities between the ages of 12 and 18 would report similar participation six years later. Multilevel logistic regression analyses revealed no demographic differences beyond age and highest level of education attained. However, continued participation was most likely among individuals who participated in a combination of voluntary and required community-based civic activities as an adolescent, and who participated in any of a number of various types of extracurricular activities. Other factors, including religiosity, sense of belonging in school, achievement, and having parents engaged in civic activities, were also positively related to continued community engagement.

AB  - Service learning is described as a socially just educational process that develops two-way learning and social outcomes for community and student participants. Despite the focus on mutuality in service learning, very little of this literature specifically deals with the intense importance of mutuality and reciprocity when working with Indigenous community partners and participants. This is problematic for Indigenous service learning projects that seek to partner respectfully with Indigenous communities in Australia and elsewhere. To address this issue, the paper draws on existing international literature and data from an Indigenous arts based service learning project conducted in the Northern Territory of Australia to propose a framework centred on relationships, reciprocity, reflexivity and representation that can be adapted for future Indigenous service learning partnerships and research.

AB  - HIV is disproportionately prevalent among Blacks. Black women most often contract HIV from having risky sex, and adolescence is a time when risky sex behaviors peak. This study tested the feasibility and initial efficacy of an intervention designed to help Black adolescent girls avoid risky sex behaviors. The intervention included group education for girls followed by a service learning opportunity in which the girls practiced the assertiveness and communication skills they had learned in the education sessions, and individual education for the girls' mothers. The intervention was guided by a risk and protective factors framework and by the goal of promoting racial/ethnic pride in the girls. We determined that the intervention was feasible. Schools allowed recruitment of potential participants and the use of their facilities for meeting with the girls. We encountered little participant dropout from the study, and the intervention was highly regarded by the girls who participated and their mothers. We found improvements in aspects of the girls' relationships with their mothers, their sexual assertiveness, and their self-efficacy to use condoms.

AB  - This dissertation studies the impact of two courses, “Rise Up” and “Leadership in Community Service,” at a Level Four high school in Massachusetts. The school, which had a higher than average level of student dropout, implemented the two courses developed by the researcher to address student retention, academic performance, and connection to school. Students in grades 9–12 took one or both of the semester-long classes, which used community building activities, group discussions, democratic teaching principals, community service-learning, and goal setting to address the needs of marginalized students. Students who participated in the classes showed increased connections to peers, teachers and community members, an improvement in indicators for school retention including grades, behavior, and attendance, and also an increase in their perceptions about their ability to persist in challenging situations.

AB  - In 2010, the National Center for Learning and Civic Engagement (NCLCE) established the Schools of Success, a national network of 19 schools that use service-learning as an instructional strategy. The schools were part of a three-year project to examine how the elements of service-learning might enhance key student outcomes, such as academic performance and civic engagement. This brief reports on the relationships observed between students' participation in service-learning and academic performance and school attendance.

We replicate the estimation approach of Campbell (1998) and find a strongly positive effect from attendance at Catholic school or private independent schools on community service participation, civic skills, civic confidence, political knowledge and political tolerance. The results are reasonably robust to alternative specifications. We consider the implications of these results for policy. (Contains 7 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - In this quasi-experimental study, a convenience sample was selected from eighth grade social studies students. There were 28 students who participated in the Student-Directed Inquiry group utilizing problem-based service learning, and 32 students in the Teacher-Directed Inquiry group. This study was designed to measure the extent of the effects of problem-based service learning (PBSL) as a Student-Directed Inquiry approach as compared to a Teacher-Directed Inquiry not utilizing problem-based service learning, on eighth graders’ motivation to apply creative problem solving and critical thinking, and as a measure of its impact on students’ sense of civic responsibility. Three research questions were examined. The first question was analyzed with a MANOVA to determine the effects of assignment to group on creative problem solving and critical thinking skills as measured by the CM3 II+. The five scales from the instrument included: Mental Focus, Learning Orientation, Creative Problem Solving, Cognitive Integrity, and Scholarly Rigor. The Teacher-Directed Inquiry group had significantly higher scores on two scales, Mental Focus (M = 32.06, p =.001), and Learning Orientation (M = 34.44, p = .007). The second research question was a posttest only design, and was analyzed with an ANOVA to determine the effects of assignment to group on students’ civic responsibility. No significant differences were found. The third research question sought to determine the degree and manner in which group assignment, and motivation to use creative problem solving and critical thinking skills, predicts students’ civic responsibility. A Multiple Regression was used to analyze these results. It was determined that the set of independent variables were able to predict the dependent variable ( F(6, 53) = 4.392, p < .001).

AB  - Although learning has traditionally happened within the four walls of a classroom, as service learning courses become more prevalent, instructors are challenging their students to take learning outside of the classroom and into the community. Service learning has the potential to transform students and their learning, it is not widely known how to ensure students are motivated to complete these assignments and see them as relevant to their futures. This study used social determination theory and a 2X2 experimental design to survey 271 students about their motivation to complete a service learning project presented to them in an assignment sheet and perceived relevance of the assignment and overall attitude toward service learning. Findings indicate that overall students have positive attitudes toward service learning, are moderately motivated to complete service learning assignments, and see them as relevant. How the assignment sheet is framed largely does not have implications for these feelings.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of mandatory community service to prepare all high school students in a large urban school district for civic engagement. The principal hypothesis asserted that mandatory community service was insufficient in influencing students' civic engagement orientations (CEO) unless accompanied by opportunities for receiving social support. Survey data for this study were collected from all seniors in the district's 17 high schools (N = 1,741) and ordinary least squares was applied in a hierarchical regression in four stages. Findings supported the moderating effect of social support in mandatory service learning especially having a mentor. Students' CEOs, however, were most affected by their perceptions of neighborhood vitality and civic discourse access. Recommendations center on improving the urban district's mandatory community service policy by implementing systems and community partnerships that enable equitable student access to socially supportive community adults and promote deeper integration of service-learning into the broader curriculum.

AB  - The links between prosocial action and health in adolescence have not been a central area of inquiry in the social sciences. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of literature that provides some hint about this intersection. This is partly due to the relatively recent national interest in volunteerism and the forms of it mandated or encouraged by school districts. These forms of service often travel under the banners of service learning and community service (Billig, 2004; Clary & Roehlkepartain, in press; Scales, & Benson, 2005; Scales & Roehlkepartain, 2004). And a voluminous body of research has documented the relationship of these programs to various indicators of adolescent well-being. Complementing this wave of research is an assortment of studies looking at other forms of adolescent engagement in actions variously labeled as prosocial behavior, generosity, or altruism. In exploring the linkages between these behaviors and health, this chapter (1) defines adolescent health, (2) synthesizes the published literature, (3) explores a large data set on 6th- to 12th-grade students to address additional empirical issues, and (4) recommends new lines of inquiry needed to advance knowledge about the altruism and health relationship.

AB  - The study examined the impact a service-learning instructional strategy had on senior high school students' engagement in a heterogeneous English class during the spring semester. The research question asked, In what ways does service-learning as an instructional strategy help maintain the academic engagement of senior high school students enrolled in a graduation required English class? Denzin and Lincoln (2000) defined service-learning as a guided discovery and instructional strategy within an existing curriculum where students actively engaged in knowledge acquisition instead of passively receiving knowledge. A mixed methodology was used to collect data using surveys, drawings, journals, a focus group interview, and reflections to determine the level of engagement of the participants in the study. Participants' data revealed three themes, reciprocal learning, defined as student classroom learning applied in a community setting; empowered learning, defined as students' ability to make decisions about their education that allows for a personal ownership in the process and the outcome of their learning; and, persistence to graduation, defined as the students continued learning to graduation. The results demonstrated that traditional teaching methods employed in the English curriculum at the participants' school may be enhanced by participating in a service-learning course in the senior year. The limited findings suggest that inclusion of a service-learning curriculum in a senior English class does have a positive impact on the engagement in a senior's final semester of high school.

AB  - This report illustrates how community service learning can be used as a vehicle for achieving the goals of education and youth development and, concurrently, how it is highly consistent with the goals of systemic educational reform, particularly in rural schools and communities. Part 1 covers the definition of service learning as a method of teaching and learning; the need for service learning, including a brief historical overview and rationale; the different types of service learning; examples of service learning curricula for elementary and secondary students; the nature of service learning instruction, including the concept of reflection and the issue of assessment; barriers to integrating service learning into curriculum and instruction; and the purported benefits and proven results of service learning. This section also addresses special concerns of rural schools and communities and provides examples of rural service learning initiatives. The second section addresses the convergence of service learning and educational reform and covers definitions of systemic educational reform; linkages between service learning and Goals 2000: Educate America Act and other legislative initiatives; relationship of service learning and school-to-work transition as reform strategies; views of educators regarding the relationship of service learning and systemic reform; descriptions of state-level approaches to service learning in Colorado, Maryland, and Delaware; relationship of service learning to teaching standards and teacher education; and a teacher's insights into how a school's culture can be transformed to include service learning. Appendices include implementation strategies for integrating service learning into curriculum and instruction; a list of resource guides, organizations related to service learning and the National Service-Learning Cooperative Partners; and a description of the K-12 Clearinghouse on Service-Learning. Contains 85 references. (LP)

AB  - What does it mean to teach children to be "good citizens," for example, in conflict resolution and service learning activities? This study addressed that question by examining contrasting conceptions of "good citizenship" that were enacted in several peer conflict mediation programs implemented in urban elementary schools. In 1995, the Winning against Violent Environments mediation training program was expanded into the Cleveland Public Schools Center for Conflict Resolution. In school-based peer mediation, the mediator is supposed to neither judge nor investigate facts nor counsel nor offer suggestions regarding the conflict itself. Mediators are responsible for process only for assisting peers to communicate with one another and to negotiate a solution to their problem themselves. A small group of students per school are trained to provide mediation service; these student mediators typically meet and work together as a team to deepen their skills and to promote the use of nonviolent conflict resolution in their school communities. The overall research question was "What processes of conflict resolution learning are being facilitated at each school, and what are the observable effects of these processes among peer mediators and within each whole school community?" A range of qualitative and quantitative information was collected between 1997-1999 in the 10 schools whose programs had developed the furthest. All the peer mediation programs examined embodied notions of democratic service learning principles and notions of citizenship, but only a few embodied "democratic" citizenship, by including critical reflection, decision making, and autonomous action by the young people themselves. Challenges which emerge in developing these programs are: fairness; capacity of mediation programs to serve the school's whole client population; capacity of a program to grow and develop in the context of a school timetable; and helping diverse students to learn the basics of democratic citizenship in an imperfectly democratic system.

AB  - The Service-Learning Model (SLM) (Delve, Mintz, and Stewart, 1990) provided an important conceptual framework for assessing the developmental effects of service-learning while outlining a relationship between service and social responsibility. Albert (1996) using the SLM as a framework, asserted that students who choose to become involved in immersion experiences have progressed to or beyond realization, the third of the model's five phases, merely by deciding on participation in extended, direct service to a single issue or community (185). Olney and Grande (1995) developed the Scale for Social Responsibility Development (SSRD) in order to empirically validate the SLM. This study focused on assessing the long term positive effects of an immersion community service-learning program, Navajo Nation Alternative Spring Break (ASB) on the participant's level of social responsibility and the impact the participants previous community service-learning has on his or her development. Additionally, this study focused on the importance of reflection and assumed that participants who wrote in their reflective journals during the Navajo Nation ASB experience would score higher on the SSRD. The SLM had never been tested on a group of alumni; therefore, this study contributed significantly to the community service-learning research literature. The results of this study indicated that both the students involved with the 1998 Navajo Nation ASB and the past participants scored at or beyond the realization subscale within the SLM. Very little distinction was found when the SLM subscales were compared with the participant's previous community service-learning experience for the 1998 Navajo Nation ASB participants, but, there was a stronger positive relationship found with the alumni group. This study also found very little developmental differences between journal and non-journal writers. Pre- and post-trip interviews were conducted in order to recognize subtle shifts in the thought processes for the 1998 Navajo Nation ASB participants as they related to their awareness of citizenship and social responsibility. There was very little distinction found between the participants pre- and post-trip attitudes toward citizenship and social responsibility.

AB  - This study compared more than 1,000 high school students who participated in service-learning programs with those who did not participate in schools matched for similar demographics and student achievement profiles. The intention was to estimate the effects of service-learning compared to more traditional ways of teaching similar subject areas. The outcomes measured ranged from civic knowledge, behaviors, and dispositions to school engagement factors, such as attachment to school and enjoyment of coursework, that generally predict academic success. Students came from sites in the southeast, north central, and western parts of the United States. More than half of the students in the sample were Latino/Hispanic. Although service-learning students scored higher than comparison students on several outcomes, most of the differences were not statistically significant. Service-learning students were significantly more likely to say that they intended to vote and that they enjoyed school. There were substantial differences in outcomes among the various service-learning programs in the study. The study suggests that service-learning is effective when it is implemented well, but it is no more effective than conventional social studies classes when the conditions are not optimal. In particular: (1) Student outcomes improved when service-learning programs lasted longer, although year-long programs often had slightly less benefit than semester-long programs; (2) Teacher characteristics were related to outcomes--Number of years of teaching experience was significantly related to some student outcomes (valuing school, enjoying math and science, civic skills, and civic dispositions). Longer experience using service-learning was associated with higher civic knowledge, civic dispositions, and efficacy scores; (3) The type of service project was related to the outcomes. Students who engaged in direct service (e.g., tutoring or visiting seniors) were most attached to their communities--Students who engaged in indirect service (e.g., fundraising or research) showed the highest levels of academic engagement. Students who engaged in political or civic action (e.g., circulating a petition or organizing a community forum) scored highest on civic knowledge and civic dispositions; and (4) The literature has identified a set of best practices or "Essential Elements" of service-learning. The study found that some of these elements were related to positive student outcomes, but some were not. who did not use service-learning were almost as likely as those who did to use "active" instructional techniques. Thus, based on this study, it does not appear that service-learning competes against passive, lecture-style classes. Instead, it competes against mixed forms of instruction that include student projects, presentations, debates, and field trips. The study found that the use of active teaching techniques was most beneficial for student outcomes, and service-learning conferred a small additional benefit over other active pedagogies.

AB  - Service-learning is an instructional approach for learning curricular objectives. In implementing service-learning, young people identify community needs, plan ways in which they can help meet those needs, implement their plans through provision of community service, and reflect on their successes and challenges. As a character education approach, service-learning emphasizes the development of social responsibility, citizenship and civic engagement, efficacy, and skills related to tackling community issues, such as research, planning, decision making, and problem solving. This article provides results and analysis from a 4-year service-learning character education grant in Philadelphia. Middle and high school students engaged in a variety of service-learning projects facilitated by community partner organizations and well-prepared teachers. Using primarily quantitative data, the study shows that service-learning can be an effective tool for reaching character education outcomes. Significant differences were found between service-learning participants and nonparticipants in multiple areas, including citizenship and civic engagement, social responsibility, and caring, as measured by surveys; suspensions and serious incidents; and academic achievement scores. Moderators of outcomes included teacher experience and quality of service-learning practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The K-12 Service-Learning Standards and Indicators for Quality Practice were published in 2008. These standards were created on the basis of an extensive review of the literature within the field of K-12 service-learning and the larger body of literature on effective practices in education. This chapter presents some of the literature on which the standards were based and an analysis of the extent to which the standards are associated with positive outcomes for middle and high school programs implemented in the School District of Philadelphia. Using a quasi-experimental design, researchers compared changes in various academic measures between students in high-quality service-learning programs and students in matched classrooms that did not implement service-learning. Students in high-quality programs, as defined by the standards, showed more statistically significant positive outcomes than their nonparticipating peers on measures of academic achievement, attendance, tardiness, and suspensions. Possible explanations and implications for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract: The paper reports results of three studies that used a formative assessment (FA) framework to compare schools that vary in their level of functioning as professional learning communities with respect to three processes: classroom assessment (study 1), development and implementation of school-based curriculum (study 2), and pedagogical conversations at teachers’ lounge professional meetings (study 3). When performed at their best, these three are inquiry processes that follow the phases of formative assessment cycles. Results supported the conclusion that school-based professional learning communities (SBPLC) make a difference in terms of FA practices enacted at both classroom and organizational levels. Moreover, classroom culture seems to mirror the organizational culture, where attributes considered as enhancing FA practice are clearly more noticeable in the high SBPLC group than in the low one.

AB  - An action research project implemented a program for the development of citizenship, cultural awareness, and positive character attributes. Targeted population consisted of middle and high school students in several growing, middle class communities located in northern Illinois. Problems of lack of awareness and sensitivity are documented through data revealing decreased civic awareness with a definite need to have students participate in activities that promote democracy and cultural awareness. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students were monocultural--lacking in community service skills and citizenship responsibilities. Faculty reported a need for better awareness on students' part for community and school involvement and better citizenship skills. Student surveys revealed a lack of participation in community service and a need for development of basic citizenship skills including more intercultural competency. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the selection of three major categories of intervention: (1) service learning, (2) character development, and (3) multicultural competency. Post-intervention data indicated an increase in student involvement in community and school activities, an increased understanding of their role and responsibilities as a citizen, and a growing sensitivity to diverse cultures. Appended are two student surveys, the staff interview, a character traits inventory, a holiday cultural project, a community resources/service learning report sheet, a public service practicum examination, and a discussion lesson with questions.

AB  - Nine of the 12 principles for effective leadership programs suggested by R. Woyach and K. Cox (1997) were used in the creation of a teen leadership program in Fort Worth, Texas. With support from several sources, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service in Tarrant County created 4-H Youth for Community Action (4-HYCA), an after-school leadership development program targeting teens in three inner-city middle schools. The program provided opportunities for inner city youth to learn and practice leadership skills in a service-learning environment. The program used an experiential model to teach youth leadership skills. Program leaders met weekly with each group of students for 12 weeks. Participants were asked how they perceived their knowledge level prior to the program as part of a posttest. The use of experiential activities combined with service learning proved to be a successful model for teaching leadership skills to these students. The students also successfully carried out three significant community service programs in their neighborhoods. Students from two sites painted houses of elderly women, while students from the other school repaired an area of erosion in a park. The model used in the 4-HYCA program is one that can be implemented in any youth-serving organization. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)

Through an informal survey of 13 special education teachers, the effects on students' socialization, behavior, attitudes, attendance, academic skills, functional skills, and relationships with nondisabled peers were explored. Findings indicate changes in socialization noted by all but 1 teacher; 11 teachers reported behavioral changes, 7 noted academic changes, 9 reported changes in functional skills, and all reported changes in attitudes. Only 4 teachers reported changes in attendance; 7 reported changes in relationships with nondisabled peers. Overall, changes were found for adolescents with mild disabilities in attendance and academic skills and for adolescents with moderate to profound disabilities in socialization and relationships with nondisabled peers.

AB  - Advance is a flexible, school-based program that provides young people with the opportunity to volunteer or implement a project of benefit to their communities. An evaluation of this partnership between a state government office for youth, government secondary schools and community organisations found that a universal program such as Advance could engage a diverse group of young people. Many of the young Advance participants face barriers to success in education and do not have the social capital to facilitate supportive personal networks. Advance contributes to the community's capacity to partner young people and broaden community links that are pivotal to young people's sense of connectedness and belonging.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine students' expected and observable civic engagement in a Montessori Erdkinder-based middle school classroom. Research questions included: (a) In what ways is civic engagement addressed in the Montessori Erdkinder-based middle school explicit curriculum? (b) How does the expected civic engagement in the Montessori Erdkinder-based middle school explicit curriculum align with The Civic Mission of Schools six educational approaches? (c) In what ways do students experience civic engagement at the end-of-the-school year in Grades 7, 8 and 9 in a Montessori Erdkinder-based middle school classroom? The study used a case design with three embedded units of analysis. The purposefully selected participants included the teacher and 19 students. The curriculum was analyzed using document analysis and context was provided through teacher interviews. The curriculum was aligned with The Civic Mission of Schools' six approaches. Students' civic engagement was examined through observations, students' interviews and documents. Cross-case analysis examined civic engagement experiences between each grade level. These analyses were compared findings to civic education literature and The Civic Mission of Schools' six approaches. The study found the curriculum provided opportunities for civic engagement including civic and political skills, civic dispositions and community participation. When compared with The Civic Mission of Schools, the curriculum provided mixed results. Only the students' voices in school governance and service-learning were evident. Students had similar opportunities for civic engagement because of the mixed-age nature of Montessori learning. Evidence of student civic engagement included a student created and maintained democratic classroom environment, community service and service-learning, informal discussion of current events and participation in the Montessori Model United Nations. Although the curriculum did not directly align with The Civic Mission of Schools, it provided an example of (a) an apolitical curriculum for creating world citizens and (b) a model for civility for classroom governance and student behavior. A community of practice was developed based on occupation-based learning in which students learned their roles and experienced stress in a democratic workplace. Recommendations for future research include political socialization and alternative learning environments.

AB  - This report recounts that many impressive projects in Massachusetts Learn and Serve America school-based sites have been observed. The term "project" is used in the report to refer to community service learning (CSL) as it is incorporated into classroom instruction. In general, the report notes, the projects ranged from simple to complex, short-term to year-long, individual classroom to whole school, sometimes involving a schoolwide theme. It states that there are five Massachusetts school districts in which CSL implementation was intended as a systemwide initiative: Boston, Hudson, Sharon, Springfield, and Westport. The report adds that the community served ranged from the school itself to the world as community, addressing such universal issues as hunger and environmental pollution. The report outlines the criteria used for choosing examples of outstanding projects and then lists project examples in sections by elementary, middle school, and secondary levels. Since many projects involved collaborations between levels, some are listed at both levels in the report. A site contact list is provided at the end of the project listings to assist interested persons in obtaining information about particular projects. The report concludes with an index by topic to community service learning projects. (BT)

AB  - Preventing HIV transmission is a major world health goal. The international nursing shortage and the cost of educational and healthcare require innovative approaches to meet this goal. The initiative described provided HIV education at three levels: to students in an R.N. to BSN program, lay health advisors (LHA's), and participants in a high-risk community. Students completed the traditional community needs assessment and teaching plans. Additionally, they contributed to funding proposals, implemented and evaluated their plan. They prepared LHA's as peer group educators. This was cost-effective and increased credibility in an African-American community. Using tested materials tailored to this population, six LHA's conducted 24 sessions in two months. Of the 168 community participants, 151 completed the pre-and post-test of HIV knowledge. Correct responses increased significantly overall from 81.9% to 88.3 (t = 4.88, df = 150; p = .001). The three items with the greatest change in correct responses related to African American HIV exposure, female condoms, and lubricants. Rationale for the project and recommendations for improvement are included.

AB  - This study employs a life-course approach to investigate the role of participation in school-based extracurricular activities as a compensatory source of social capital for adolescents, particularly those reared in non-traditional families and the effect of participation on early adult outcomes. Using Waves I and III from the Add Health data, civic involvement in young adulthood is examined. Interestingly, adolescent extracurricular activities are no more important for children from alternative family structures. However, benefits of participation are still evident from this examination, even when controlling for measures of social capital. Survey analysis techniques which control for the complex sampling design in Add Health are used.

AB  - "Building Decision Skills" aims to raise middle and high school students' awareness of ethics, help them gain practical experience in developing core values, and give them practical strategies for dealing with ethical dilemmas. "Building Decision Skills" consists of 10 lessons that can fill two consecutive weeks of daily lessons or be drawn out over a longer period. Using readings, handouts, and overheads, the teacher covers key concepts. Students are encouraged to think about the key concepts through small-group activities, class discussions, and homework assignments. The program also includes schoolwide components (such as group discussions, seminars, and assemblies). And it can be combined with service learning. One study of "Building Decision Skills" met the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards with reservations. This study included nearly 300 high school students attending a large suburban high school in St. Louis, Missouri, and examined results on students' knowledge, attitudes, and values. "Building Decision Skills," combined with service learning, was found to have potentially positive effects on students' knowledge, attitudes, and values.

AB  - Letter writing as an alternative to a traditional laboratory report was introduced for a general chemistry laboratory project in which students measure lead content in urban soils. Furthermore, this letter-writing activity was conducted within the framework of a service-learning project insomuch as the students' letters were written to the homeowner who provided the samples. The benefits of a letter-writing activity in lieu of a traditional laboratory report are discussed, as well as the benefits of implementing this type of assignment as a service-learning project. A follow-up survey indicated that 94% of the students who completed the letter-writing assignment felt it caused them to "think about the chemistry involved in a different [and we believe deeper] way" compared to writing a traditional laboratory report.

AB  - Many students graduate from high school lacking the social networks needed to function and to participate in a democratic society; they are entering adulthood uninterested in the social and political issues that affect their lives and their communities. The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to examine attitudes and experiences of secondary students who participated in service learning and a civic responsibility course. Dewey's theory that community service results in an improved citizenry and Erikson's identity formation theory informed this work. Thirty-seven students in grades 10-12 enrolled in a rural public school in a southern U.S. state completed pre and post service learning surveys adapted from Berkowitz and Lutterman's Social Responsibility Scale, and 12 students participated in focus group interviews after service learning participation. Survey data were analyzed using the chi-square test for independence. Interview data were analyzed using an interpretive approach and a priori and open coding. Results indicated a significant relationship between service learning participation and civic responsibility attitude ratings. Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: A new understanding of service learning, service learning's impact on community awareness, service learning's impact on self awareness, and service learning's impact on future civic engagement and civic responsibility. Most participants were more willing to participate in service after the service learning experience. Applying what they learned from the classroom to an actual need in the community resulted in feelings of interest and responsibility toward the community. Implications for social change include the linking of school and community through service learning that provide opportunities for students to engage in public life.

AB  - This descriptive study sought to determine student perceptions about whether the Ecology Corps extracurricular program at Sudlersville Middle School strengthened their personal development attributes. The four areas of personal development measured were character/personal responsibility, leadership/team-building, service to community/service-learning, and awareness and appreciation of the natural environment. The student organization studied is located at a small, rural, school on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The population selected for this study was involved with the student organization over a thirteen year period from 1995 to 2008. The research conducted for this study involved a mailed survey of 115 former members of the Ecology Corps and a phone survey of seventeen former members. Comparisons were made between students who completed the program (Completers) and those who did not (Non-Completers). The majority of mailed and phone survey respondents reported that the Ecology Corps did improve all four personal development attributes, with the highest number of positive responses being reported in the area of awareness and appreciation of the natural environment. This study demonstrated that middle school students will do hard work, but work and learning activities must be balanced with recreational activities. Also demonstrated was that student leadership/teamwork and character/personal responsibility can be developed, and that awareness and appreciation for the natural environment can be increased.

AB  - This dissertation examines factors that prepare a group of immigrant high school students participating in an after-school program to engage in civic life as adults. A demographic shift indicates a significant increase in foreign-born and first generation students (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000), at a time when multicultural communities are challenging long held notions about civic participation and civic life in America. Focusing on the qualities needed for immigrant youth to become civically involved, and the kinds of activities that can foster their engagement, I explore the process whereby they acquire the skills, competencies, relationships, and orientations needed to look after the welfare of their own community and the well being of society at large. This study frames an examination of the experiences of a small group of immigrant youth participating in the T.E.A.C.H. (Teen Educators Advocating For Community Health) program within literature that addresses the difficulties experienced by immigrant youth in school, and the efficacy of civic education classes, service learning experiences, and extracurricular activities. Five years of participant observation of adults and youth in an after-school program that incorporated community service, career development, and a class on public health issues related to adolescents produced data on (1) the roles that communicative competence, social affiliation, and civic responsibility play in the development of civic engagement, (2) the configurations and elements of activities that can facilitate the acquisition of these three qualities, and (3) the impact that acquiring these components had on the youth. Analytical tools drawn from the socio cultural literature on development provided a process view of individuals who moved from the periphery of society and took up more central positions with their peers and communities. The findings suggest that activities which promote the development of skills and competencies, intergenerational contact, and a sense of responsibility towards others can change how immigrant youth orient towards the larger social world. Because immigrant youth often lack communicative skills, confidence, and social capital, those who are given opportunities to develop these assets can make a difference in their communities.

AB  - This mixed-method research study looked at the effects service-learning had on student classroom engagement levels. The research questions that drove this study were: 1.Did teachers and students find service-learning to be a positive experience? 2.What impact did service-learning have on student classroom engagement? This study was conducted in 12 different science classrooms and included 267 eighth grade students at Seckman Middle School. The study compared the levels of student engagement in six classrooms that incorporated service-learning within their study of the environment with the level of student engagement in the other six classrooms that did not participate in service-learning. Student surveys done at the beginning and conclusion of the study, along with the student focus group, were used as qualitative data along with the teacher survey. Classroom observations done daily throughout this study were used to gather quantitative data on the different levels of student engagement in the service-learning classrooms as compared to the non-service-learning classrooms. The limitations to this study were the limited amount of time to gather the classroom observation data as well as the limited data sampling included in this study. The qualitative data collected through the teacher surveys and the student surveys, as well as the student focus group, supported the first research hypothesis that teachers and students found service-learning to be a positive experience. The classroom observation data that were collected in the quantitative part of this study showed that the service-learning students had higher levels of engagement when compared to the non-service-learning students. While some tests supported the hypothesis that service-learning students do have higher levels of classroom engagement, some of the tests did not support this. With the analysis of the data collected on the five different statistical tests, the results were inconclusive based on this sample.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a rural transition service--Learning for Life. A transition curriculum was designed to meet the unique transition needs of seventh and eighth grade students with mild disabilities in a rural k-12 school in Red Level, Alabama. The curriculum was written by a four-member collaborative team from Red Level High School. The curriculum integrated the Alabama Basic Competency skills with life skills, vocational skills, and study skills. The vocational skills area offered students the skills needed to work in the school-based entrepreneurial project. The subjects were 29 seventh and eighth grade students with mild disabilities. There were 15 students in the treatment group and 14 students in the control group. Data were collected from intact groups located in two demographically similar rural schools in the Covington County School System. Students in the treatment group received 24 weeks of exposure to the Learning for Life curriculum. Students from the control group were exposed to the existing curriculum based on remediation of Alabama Basic Competency Skills. Pretest and posttest measures were taken on both groups using the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1985) to measure academic achievement, the Self-Esteem Inventories (Coopersmith, 1981) to measure self-esteem, and the Responsibility and Independence Scale for Adolescents (Salvia, Neisworth, & Schmidt, 1990) to measure adaptive behavior. A split-plot research design was utilized in this study. The data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Results suggest that educators may take an innovative approach to providing instruction without causing a decrease in the variables that the school system deems important measures of successful student outcomes--academic achievement, self-esteem, and adaptive behavior.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine how community service learning affects students’ engagement and mathematical understanding of geometric transformations. Six African American and four Latino American sixth grade students participated in the study. These students attended an after-school community learning service activity over the course of a semester. The community service activity centered on promoting art and culture awareness in their school while the academic goal focused on geometric transformations. The questions that guided the study are (1) how can community service learning engage African and Latino Americans in learning geometry, and (2) what is the nature of African and Latino Americans’ growth in understandings of geometric transformations. For each research question, both quantitative and qualitative data was collected and analyzed. Quantitative data included a pre-and posttest Engagement questionnaire and a pre- and posttest Mathematics Understanding assessment. Qualitative data involved researcher notes, transcriptions, reflection journals, interviews, and Mathematics Understanding assessment. Quantitative data was analyzed by employing nonparametric statistical methods. For the qualitative data, Lave & Wenger’s (1991) framework on legitimate peripheral participation was applied to examine participants’ engagement in mathematics. Also, Pirie & Kieren’s (1994) growth in mathematical understanding model was used to analyze students’ improvement in their mathematical understanding of transformations. The findings from the quantitative data did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in African and Latino Americans’ engagement or their growth in understanding geometric transformations. The results from the qualitative data showed that community service learning engages African and Latino Americans in the mathematics and the activity and may promote students’ understanding of growth in understanding of geometric transformations.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a large study on the relationship between school and civic engagement and the self-perceived participation in political activities of ethnic Chinese and South Asian immigrant students in Hong Kong. Data was collected from a sample of 5,574 6th-11th graders aged 12-19. The nature of school engagement was assessed by a self-rated questionnaire against the affective, behavioral and cognitive domains. Students' civic engagement was measured by the ICCS student questionnaire (Schulz et al., 2009). Before running the regression analyses, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed and the results showed that both instruments had good construct validity and internal consistency. Consistent with the primary aim of this study, MANOVA analyses indicate significant student group differences in school engagement, and civic related self-belief and behaviours. Our findings showed that non-Chinese speaking South Asian students (NCS) scored higher than their mainstream Chinese and newly arrived students from Mainland China (NAS) counterparts across the dimensions of both instruments. Results of hierarchical regressions confirmed that school engagement was significant in predicting expected political participation in the future. The effects of school and civic engagement on future political participation varied significantly between all studied groups. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] U radu se iznose rezultati velikog istraživanja o odnosu angažiranosti u školi i građanske angažiranosti te samopredodžbe o sudjelovanju u političkim aktivnostima učenika kineske etničke pripadnosti i južnoazijskih učenika imigranata u Hong Kongu. Podaci su prikupljeni na uzorku od 5574 učenika od šestoga do jedanaestoga razreda, u dobi od dvanaest do devetnaest godina. U procjeni angažiranosti u školi primijenjen je anketni upitnik za ispitivanje afektivne, biheviorističke i kognitivne dimenzije. Građanska angažiranost učenika mjerena je upitnikom ICCS za učenike (Schulz et al., 2009). Prije regresijskih analiza provedena je konfirmatorna faktorska analiza (CFA), a rezultati su pokazali da oba instrumenta imaju dobru konstruk-tnu valjanost i unutarnju konzistentnost. U skladu s primarnim ciljem istraživanja, rezultati MANOVA analize pokazuju značajne razlike među učeničkim skupinama u angažiranosti u školi, građanskom samouvjerenju i ponašanju. Prema dobivenim rezultatima južnoazijski učenici koji ne govore kineski (NCS) u većoj se mjeri priklanjaju svim mjerenim dimenzijama u oba upotrijebljena instrumenta nego domicilni Kinezi i novopridošli učenici iz kontinentalne Kine. Rezultati hijerarhijskih regresijskih analiza potvrdili su da je angažiranost u školi značajni prediktor očekivane političke aktivnosti. Učinci angažiranosti u školi i građanske angažiranosti na buduće političko djelovanje značajno su varirali između svih anketiranih grupa.

AB  - Many young people do community service of one sort or another, volunteering their time and effort for many worthwhile causes; in many cases, this community service has become a formal part of students' learning. Service-learning (SL), the integration of community service with an academic curriculum, is the focus of this chapter. The next sections define SL in more detail, indicate its potential benefits, and then offer recommendations on how to plan and conduct such programs effectively. SL is more than just volunteering. It is intended to promote student learning by integrating community service with an educational curriculum that includes guided reflection. In addition to academic benefits, SL can foster personal and social growth in its participants that can include heightened self-esteem, civic engagement, and prosocial values. In addition, it can have positive effects on schools and the community. Ideally, as a result of effective SL project, students become more actively engaged in their education and learn not only how to be continual contributors to their communities, but also how to become responsible, mindful individuals who are able to apply skills learned in the classroom to the real world. Building a well-designed program is a challenge but well worth the effort. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Childhood physical abuse is a major risk factor for suicide attempt, but factors that moderate this risk remain largely unexamined. Moderated mediation analysis was used with 186 adolescents who responded to the Profiles of Student Life: Attitudes and Behavior survey. Physical abuse increased risk directly and indirectly through reduced self-esteem. Involvement in youth programs moderated the direct effect. Community service moderated the indirect effect. Results indicate 2 hours per week of involvement in youth programs and 2 hours per week of community service mitigated suicide attempt risk associated with abuse. Providing avenues for youth experiencing abuse to increase their community service and involvement is recommended. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The essential condition for promoting a Service-learning Project is the community members’ commitment which is a challenge under the prevailing pedagogical practices in the educational institutions. On this basis, Service-learning projects were launched with 117 students in three public secondary education schools in Queretaro, Mexico, to analyze the impact on improvement of this methodology in school climate. The projects were developed for six months, and were used a participation questionnaire as well as a school climate scale to collect information. In this paper are presented the results from this experience of intervention. The outcomes show an improvement in the school environment, also a modification of some pedagogical practices, likewise the student body positioning as a protagonist all through the process of the project's implementation. It can be asserted that improvement of school climate cannot be achieved by enactment of laws and regulations neither to the incorporation of subjects related to topic, but it is necessary to drive methods for scholar practices and management policies transformation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) Para impulsar un proyecto de Aprendizaje Servicio (APS) es condición necesaria promover la participación de los miembros de la comunidad, lo cual supone un reto debido a las prácticas pedagógicas que imperan en las escuelas. Partiendo de ello, se pusieron en marcha proyectos de APS con 117 estudiantes en tres escuelas secundarias públicas en Querétaro, México, con el objetivo de analizar el impacto de esta metodología en la mejora de convivencia escolar. Los proyectos se desarrollaron durante seis meses, y se usó un cuestionario de participación y una escala de convivencia para recolectar información. En este trabajo se presentan los resultados de esta experiencia de intervención, los cuales muestran una mejora del clima escolar, la modificación de algunas prácticas pedagógicas, así como el posicionamiento del alumnado como protagonista del proceso de implementación del proyecto. Se puede afirmar que la mejora de la convivencia no se da a partir de la implementación de leyes y reglamentos ni de la inclusión de asignaturas respecto del tema, sino que es necesario impulsar metodologías que transformen las prácticas escolares y las políticas de gestión.

AB  - Nurturing adolescents’ voluntarism—their willingness to help needy strangers—appears to hinge on the experiential learning component embedded in a volunteer training program. Evidence for this is presented from an experimental study carried out in Hong Kong. Although program participants did not differ in voluntarism from their classmates who did not participate in the program, those who devoted more time to volunteer services were ultimately significantly higher on voluntarism. Those who volunteered for services to new immigrants, to people with mental retardation, and to chronic patients had significantly higher voluntarism levels than others. Early voluntarism did not significantly affect their volunteer participation. These findings support the role of experiential learning in the adolescent’s development of voluntarism.

AB  - Each school year, it is common for international middle schools to offer outdoor experiential education programs that take them off campus for three to seven days. The programs aim to extend learning beyond the school campus into environments that allow for the extension of one or more of the following categories of activities, adventure, leadership, team-building, service learning, and academic. The setting for these excursions is primarily outdoors, in nature, with additional activities in areas or edifices of cultural or historical significance. Although the specific objectives of each school may vary, these trips are invariably viewed as an opportunity for students to develop deeper relationships with their teachers and peers, to promote personal affective growth, and to foster a deeper understanding of the local culture that they are visiting. The term for this type of program at the school in which this study takes place is Classroom Without Walls (CWW). Looking through a social constructivist lens, and based on three literature streams, (a) friendship skills and a sense of belonging, (b) perceived competence and self-efficacy, (c) locus of control and personal responsibility, this non-experimental, pre-test/post-test quantitative study applied the ROPELOC instrument as a pre and post survey tool in order to explore the effects of CWW excursions on perceived personal abilities and sense of personal responsibility of both host national and foreign national participants. Results showed, using responses from 167 middle school students in an international school in Colombia, statistically significant gains in perceived personal abilities as well as statistically significant gains in perceived personal responsibility, while showing no statistically significant changes in ROPELOC scores based on type of student.

AB  - Troubling trends in political disengagement among young people include decreasing knowledge of and interest in political issues as well as lower rates of voting compared to previous generations. To potentially address this concern, service-learning has often been promoted in public schools as a means of educating active citizens, among other outcomes. Despite the expansion of service-learning programs, the relationship between service-learning and citizenship outcomes deserves further study. This dissertation examines the following questions: Do teachers consider “citizenship” an explicit goal for service-learning experiences in K–12 schools? How do teachers and students define what it means to be a “good citizen”? What models of citizenship are taught in schools, and through service-learning in particular? Does service-learning make a difference in students' attitudes and understanding of citizenship? I analyzed service-learning and non-service-learning (comparison) student pre-post surveys (n = 704), student interviews (n = 107) and teacher interviews (n = 28) from schools throughout California. I drew on political theories and extended a framework of citizenship models to illuminate the ways in which service-learning may foster good citizenship. Four central conclusions emerged from the data. First, the language of citizenship was missing from most classrooms, indicating that teachers were not framing service-learning as a strategy for teaching citizenship explicitly. Second, multiple models of citizenship existed in schools, including citizenship as legal status and as good behavior, which form a context for service-learning. Third, service-learning projects promoted active models of citizenship that fostered the “heart and soul” aspects of citizenship, including caring for and taking action to benefit other individuals or the community. Fourth, if citizenship is broadly defined as membership in a political community, most service-learning experiences did not connect direct service projects to broader civic and political processes, thus limiting many students' exposure to participation in a political community. Finally, I suggest implications for research, practice and policy to increase the impact of service-learning on students' understanding of what it means to be a good citizen.

AB  - Service-learning is an instructional methodology teachers can use to foster student engagement in rigorous curricula. Through service-learning, middle level students see that what they are learning in school is real and important, and that they can be valued, contributing members of society. In this article, the Titans team at Remington Middle School embraces service-learning. The "Make the Switch!" public-awareness campaign is an example of how a service-learning project can be used to expose students to curriculum standards through rich, authentic learning contexts while also promoting the social-emotional growth of young adolescents.

AB  - Violence-Prevention Outcomes in Civic Education (VOICE) is a curriculum program for elementary social studies that incorporates conflict resolution, law-related education, and service learning. These three elements are among those considered to have promise in addressing youth violence. The VOICE curriculum is designed to complement the traditional elementary grade social studies curriculum by helping students develop a deeper understanding of the United States Constitution and the three branches of government. Components of the curriculum include participatory teaching strategies, involvement of outside resource people, conflict resolution skill building, and a service project. The curriculum consists of 50 lessons in seven units of study that have a logical flow; each lesson has teacher directions and student materials for duplication. The units are: (1) "Working Together: Building a Good Foundation in Class"; (2) "Working It Out Together: Mediating Our Conflicts"; (3) "Working Together To Build a Government: Balancing Rights and Safety"; (4) "Working Together To Make Laws: The Legislative Branch"; (5) "Making the Laws Work: The Executive Branch"; (6) "Interpreting the Laws: The Judicial Branch"; and (7) "Taking Action Together: Service and Learning." The curriculum fulfills the government goals of fifth-grade social studies and supplements a typical fifth-grade U.S. history textbook. An appendix contains 6 different sample assessment tools. (BT)

AB  - Background:The ability to forge connections between academic study and real-world experience is essential in service learning (SL). Furthermore, the transition out of SL projects can be emotionally charged for both students and service recipients; yet, little research has been conducted on this topic. Purpose: This study aimed (a) to compare students’ ability to forge connections between course content and service experience and (b) to compare the transition out of their SL project between the 2016 and 2017 cohorts. Methodology/Approach: Mixed methods were used for the comparison. T tests were conducted to compare differences in the exam scores between the two cohorts. Summative content analysis was used to compare students’ weekly reflection journals for the two cohorts. Findings/Conclusions: Students were better able to make such connections when they were explicitly guided with prompting questions based on each week’s lecture topics. Students also transitioned out of their projects more smoothly when provided with a lecture, abundant reflection opportunities, and more instructor coaching. Exam scores, however, showed no statistical differences between the cohorts. Implications: Intentional efforts must be made to ensure that students relate course content to their service experience. Providing guidance on transitioning to project closure would also benefit students.

AB  - This study examines community service effects on adolescents' prosocial behaviors as mediated through experiences made during service. Based on theoretical assumptions by Youniss and Yates, we suggest that personal agency experiences and being confronted with situations that can challenge the own world views (ideology experiences) serve as mediators. The data were collected in a two-wave longitudinal study surveying 2,408 German adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years. Based on "true intraindividual change models," the results support the expected mediation of service effects on prosocial behaviors through agency, but not ideology experiences. The findings suggest that community service affects prosocial behaviors through a behavioral pathway.

AB  - Service Learning (SL) is an instructional method that connects learning with performing a service that meets the authentic needs of the community. SL can help students with disabilities develop social interactions with their peers without disabilities. This study evaluated the impact of SL on social interactions of students with and without disabilities in an inclusive high school Word Processing class through observations, questionnaires, reflections, focus group discussions and interviews. The results suggest that SL had a positive impact on peer interactions of the students but that certain changes could be made to the SL intervention to yield better results. Observation data showed that social and engaged peer interactions of students with and without disabilities increased during SL. In reflections and focus group meetings, students described positively about their experience in helping others and engaging in teamwork. In teacher interviews, the general education teacher observed positive peer interactions during SL. However, pre and post administration of Questionnaire of Social Competence did not find any significant difference. The teacher also expressed a concern that the level of work the project demanded did not match the abilities of students with disabilities. Through analysis and evaluation of the data collected, the following themes were discussed: (a) peer interactions, (b) teamwork, and (c) conditions of inclusive environments.

AB  - This purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between early service experiences and adult level of service and to construct grounded theory on why and how individuals work for social justice. The study, using both quantitative and qualitative methodology, collected data through the use of questionnaires to investigate the degree to which early experiences in service affect adult attitudes and behavior related to service and social justice. The researcher also interviewed 11 adults who were actively working for social justice to learn about their experiences in, and attitudes toward, justice work. The 1975-1999 alumni from Benilde-St. Margaret's School located in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, comprised the population for this investigation, which was segmented into those with high school community service experience, service-learning experience, and no high school service experience. The major findings indicated that early service experiences impact adult behavior and attitudes toward service and social justice by developing in individuals an ethic of service and by increasing awareness of self, others, and social issues. The analysis of the data collected from the questionnaires and the interviews resulted in a theory on how individuals develop a critical consciousness and social justice orientation to volunteering through service-learning. This theory consists of three components: (a) the common experiences, beliefs, and attitudes that lead a person to work for social justice; (b) stages of critical consciousness development through service-learning; and (c) stage-appropriate information, experiences, and reflection to foster students' critical consciousness.

AB  - The underachievement of students in the US is a growing and significant problem. When guided by the K-12 Service-Learning Standards for Quality Practice, research has shown service-learning results in increased academic achievement among middle and high school students. This study focused on identifying the impact of service learning interventions on the math achievement and problem-solving skills of elementary students. The core study problem was the math underachievement of low income fourth grade elementary students in a rural, Title I school in Georgia. The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability of the K-12 Service-Learning Standards for Quality Practice on overcoming underachievement of elementary students in mathematics. The theoretical framework of constructivism was used to develop the study. The epistemology approach used to acquire knowledge from study was positivism. Using a quantitative comparative study, data from three different groups was analyzed to best understand the impact of service-learning strategies in an elementary setting. For a period of six weeks, Experimental Group 1 received a “high-quality” SL intervention by integrating six of the research-based service-learning strategies as presented by NYLC in the K-12 SL standards into the existing math curriculum. Experimental Group 2 served as the “general” SL intervention group by integrating two of the K-12 SL standards over a period of three weeks. Group 3 served as the comparison group and implemented the math curriculum without the use of SL over a period of six weeks. The Measures of Academic Progress test was used as a pre- and post-assessment among participants. Analysis of variance was used to compare participants’ academic achievement on pre- and post-assessments. ANOVA performed on students’ academic achievement were significant. A Tukey post hoc test indicated there was a statistically significant difference in student achievement posttest scores between Experimental Group 1 (high-quality SL group) and the comparison group (p = 0.00 < α = 0.05), as well as between Experimental Group 1 and Experimental Group 2 (p = 0.04 < α = 0.05). However, there were no significant differences found between the comparison group and Experimental Group 2 ( p = 0.29 > α = 0.05). ANOVA performed on students’ problem-solving posttest scores indicated no statistically significant difference between the three groups. Data from the study supports the use of high-quality SL projects as an intervention to increase the math achievement of low-income, rural fourth grade students. Since there was no significant difference in posttest scores for students’ problem-solving skills, further research is needed to assess the specific mathematical domains, if any, that are impacted by high-quality SL projects. A replication of the study should be made with multiple instruments and a larger sample of students, from different schools, and across different regions.

AB  - This study used non-experimental survey research to gather data on the kinds of dropout prevention programs in place in West Virginia high schools in 2014–15 and to evaluate their effectiveness based on possible relationships between principals’ perceptions of the programs and graduation rates. The study focused on nine of 15 effective strategies for dropout prevention identified by the National Dropout Prevention Center: School-Community Collaboration, Safe Learning Environment, Family Engagement, Mentoring/Tutoring, Service Learning, Alternative School, After School, Individualized Instructional, and Career and Technical Education Programs. A tenth program, Alternative Pathways to Diploma, cited as one of four policy recommendations and best practices for West Virginia by a National Governors Association Grant Study, was added. Survey data were collected via Internet and the United States Postal Service from among the entire population of 116 West Virginia high school principals for the school year 2014–15 with a response rate of 72% (n = 83). The study identified percentages for each of the 10 programs. The Pearson Product-Moment Correlation statistical test revealed no correlation between the number of programs used and graduation rates. Independent Samples T-tests showed no relationship between programs not in use and graduation rate. A Chi-Square test did show statistical significance among principals’ perceptions of effectiveness. The ANOVA showed a relationship between principals’ perceptions and graduation rate for one program, Alternative Pathways to Diploma.

AB  - The Nobis Project is an innovative creative process approach to service-learning and global citizenship education aiming to teach secondary school students six dimensions of civic engagement: values, knowledge, skills, efficacy, commitment, and empathy. It guides students to comprehend current affairs and to devise ways to respond to local, national or global issues without direct contact with service recipients. This thesis examines the claims of the Nobis Project program using data collected from a series of five case studies each with an international focus. It analyzes how far the Nobis Project (1) realizes the goals of service-learning to teach civic engagement, and (2) teaches the civic goals of global citizenship. This thesis argues that the Nobis Project, refined in the light of this research, represents a significant contribution to the practice of service-learning in secondary schools. Its method incorporates an original creative-process model, a practice not usually found in service-learning. As a program, it redefines the scope of service-learning by including international service recipients, thus contributing to a recognized need of global citizenship education, opportunity for action.

AB  - In spring 1996 Franklin County (KY) schools conducted a research project with three teachers at Western Hills High School to determine whether student attitudes change as a result of becoming involved in service learning. Each teacher used one class for a test group and another for a control group. Two types of pre- and posttests were given to each group of students. One test gathered information on attitudes toward subject matter, the teacher, and the specific project with which the students would become involved. The other test targeted attitudes students had toward themselves, their community, and volunteering. In addition, pre- and post-project records were kept on grades and attendance for each student group. Each test group was involved in their own service-learning project (an algebra class worked with senior citizens; a pre-algebra class tutored elementary students; and a physical science class painted playground equipment, conducted soil testing, and taught elementary students about the laws of motion). Results indicated that overall, grades and attendance did not improve for the test students after involvement in the projects. Findings suggest two trends: (1) long-term projects with the same service recipients can have more of an impact than one-time or indirect projects; and (2) becoming involved in service learning has a more positive impact on student attitudes toward a social issue or group of people than on grades or attendance. Contains extensive data and a five-item bibliography. Likert tests are appended for the three projects and the semantic differential test for all three projects. (BT)

AB  - Latent growth curve modeling was used to describe longitudinal trends in community and religious involvement and Marcia’s (1966) four identity statuses (diffusion, foreclosure, moratorium, and achievement), as well as to assess relations between involvement and identity change. Cross-lagged regression models explored temporal ordering of relations between involvement and identity. The study involved 418 participants (Wave 1 M age = 17.44, SD = .81) over four occasions. Individuals on average showed decreases in community and religious involvement, identity diffusion, foreclosure, and moratorium, and no significant change in identity achievement. For community involvement, rates of change were related negatively to those for diffusion and positively to those for achievement. For religious involvement, rates of change correlated negatively with those for diffusion and moratorium, and positively with those for foreclosure. Cross-lagged models showed some effects in the expected direction (involvement to identity), as well as some reciprocal effects. All analyses were conducted for overall identity status as well as the three domains within each status (political, religious, and occupational). In short, the present study provides evidence for community and religious involvement as contexts facilitative of identity formation in late adolescence and emerging adulthood.

AB  - Framed by self-determination and identity development theories, this study examined the process through which participating in a community-based service-learning project supported high school students' feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness, and how these feelings were related to students' intentions for doing more service in the future. The goals were to understand 1) the task and time related variations in students' reports of autonomy, competence and relatedness, and 2) whether these task and time related variations differed for youth who did service voluntarily compared to those who did service to fulfill a requirement. Results showed increases in autonomy, competence and relatedness over the course of the project, as well as task-related variations in these feelings. Competence and relatedness positively predicted internalized reasons for future service. Internalized reasons positively predicted strong intentions for future service. Required and voluntary service participants reported similar levels of autonomy, competence and relatedness, as well as similar reasons and intentions for future service. Implications provide insights into designing service programs for adolescents' optimal psychosocial development during out-of-school time.

The intervention integrates science and civics instruction in a unit about community and family water conservation. The intervention also includes teacher professional development and technology-based tools to support instruction. We examined effects in science and civics, finding that student engagement in both areas was positively affected by the intervention. We argue that best practices in inquiry-based science instruction have value for students’ civic development and that the integration of science and civics in the classroom can enhance student outcomes in both fields.

AB  - This article will focus on programs designed for social and behavioral intervention with students identified as 'at-risk' with particular emphasis on examination of the effectiveness of service learning as an intervention for these students. Programs with a sound basis in cooperative learning appear to provide multiple practical benefits for young students in that they can be implemented with large academically heterogeneous groups and include critical training in social skills requisite, for school success. Mentoring programs appear to be effective when an infrastructure of training and support is available for both mentors and student participants. Service learning programs have been successful in producing specific positive social outcomes with students. Development of comprehensive models for implementation of service learning programs for students 'at risk' would appear to address the practical needs of both schools and students to establish strong adult-student connections, model and practice social behaviors in an authentic context, and address high academic expectations in a meaningful way. Further research exploring the academic and social efficacy of service learning intervention and prevention methodologies for students 'at risk' are needed.

AB  - This teacher action research study was situated in the context of secondary curriculum and instruction, motivated by the increased need to educate students to become active and participatory citizens capable of making an impact upon local and global communities to which they belong. At the heart of this study were sixteen students enrolled in a high school course, Activism and Global Citizenship, at an elite, progressive independent secondary school in a mid-Atlantic U.S. city. The study explored the students' and teacher's experiences in the course through coursework and reflection assignments to identify what pedagogical and curricular approaches best support the course's objectives to develop students' global competence and capacity to (1) investigate the world, (2) recognize different perspectives, (3) communicate effectively with diverse audiences, and (4) take appropriate action to improve the world. Findings from the study revealed that the learning context—an academically privileged environment—and the students' and teacher's different social and racial identities factored significantly into the enactment of the curriculum, experience in the course, and the extent to which the course's learning objectives were achieved. The study also found that students' understanding of themselves as activists and global citizens was mixed; some students showed little or no change while others showed considerable transformation of what they thought at the start to the end of the course. Finally, conceptual findings included the value of engaging students in authentic teaching and learning, the importance of guiding students to examine their identities and lived experiences to develop a more inclusive worldview, and the value of integrating service-learning with educating for global competence. The findings from this study advance our understanding of how an integrated service-learning and globally-oriented curriculum at an elite independent school can effectively meet the developmental needs of students setting forth in an increasingly interconnected global society. These findings also contribute to existing literature in the areas of adolescent civic engagement and identity development, service-learning curriculum, pedagogical approaches to global citizenship, pedagogy of privileged students, and civic education in elite learning environments.

AB  - A research study investigated student perspectives on service learning during the TRAIL to Wellness program, a four-week leisure education program for veterans being treated for substance abuse. The research explored the students perspectives on their own learning at the end of 15 weeks. Based upon the content analysis of open-ended questions about the service learning program, several themes emerged: 1) classroom preparation improves the service learning experience, 2) service learning activities improve students understanding of the therapeutic recreation process, and 3) the experience prompts self-awareness.

AB  - This investigation relates to the impact of service learning on leadership skills of students who are gifted in the middle school while the students plan the project in-school and execute their goals out-of-school for their yearlong service learning project called Community Problem-Solving, or CmPS. Based on surveys, observations, and interviews from 25 students identified as gifted in the middle school, this study describes the student responses and observations from the researcher and teacher of the gifted. Findings show that most of the students in the study felt that their yearlong service learning project positively impacted their leadership skills. The data reveal some grade, age, and gender variances in the post survey because they spent more time sharing ideas and implementing their goals for their service learning project. Contributions this study makes to the existing literature in gifted education are to consider service learning as a part of gifted programming at the middle school level.

AB  - Research shows that when young people participate in service, they are more likely to continue on a pathway of lifelong civic engagement. Research also shows that service-learning, an approach to education that ties community service to classroom instruction and reflection, contributes to students' success and has a positive impact on their social behavior, habits, and attitudes. In an effort to better understand the trends in community service and service-learning, the Corporation surveyed a national sample of over 2,000 K-12 public school principals regarding service in their schools and compared findings to a 1999 study, analyzing changes over time. The research report "Community Service and Service-Learning in America's Schools (2008)" provides insight into the prevalence of community service and service-learning in public schools as well as the supports and policies in place to sustain and build service-learning programs. The full report, and other research by the Corporation for National and Community Service, can be found at www.nationalservice.gov/research [also at ED506728].

AB  - This study evaluated All4You!, a theoretically based curriculum designed to reduce sexual risk behaviors associated with HIV, other STDs, and unintended pregnancy among students in alternative schools. The study featured a randomized controlled trial involving 24 community day schools in northern California. A cohort of 988 students was assessed four times during an 18-month period using a self report questionnaire. At the 6-month follow-up, the intervention reduced the frequency of intercourse without a condom during the previous 3 months, the frequency of intercourse without a condom with steady partners, and the number of times students reported having intercourse in the previous 3 months. It also increased condom use at last intercourse. These behavioral effects were no longer statistically significant at the 12- and 18-month follow-ups. The All4You! intervention was effective in reducing selected sexual risk behaviors among students in alternative school settings; however, the effects were modest and short term.

AB  - Purpose: This paper presents results from a randomized controlled trial that assessed the short-and longer-term impact of a skills-based HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum, service learning, and the combination. Methods: The study featured a four-arm experimental design involving 47 classrooms (765 youth) from continuation high schools. Classrooms were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum only; (2) service learning only; (3) HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum plus service learning; or (4) an attention control curriculum. Students completed 3 surveys over 18 months. Multi-level analysis was used to adjust for the correlation among students within the same classroom and school, and the correlation of repeated measurements. Results: Participants were 53% male (mean age: 16.2 years). The majority of youth reported being Hispanic/Latino or African-American (37.9% and 22.3%, respectively). Students in the HIV/STI/ pregnancy prevention curriculum condition were less likely to have vaginal intercourse without a condom in the 3 months prior to the survey [odds ratio (OR) = .58, p = .04]; these effects diminished by final follow-up. The program also significantly reduced students’ exposure to risky situations. These changes were not significant in the service learning only or combined intervention conditions relative to control. Conclusion: This study is one of a few controlled studies of HIV/STI and pregnancy prevention programs in continuation settings, and suggests the curriculum was effective in changing selected risk behaviors in the short term.

AB  - The Nuestro Futuro Saludable partnership designed a critical service-learning intervention focused on health equity and action. The 10-week afterschool intervention was implemented in a Boston middle school. Youths who took part in the intervention were knowledgeable about the social determinants of health in their communities, as well as to the barriers to health. Our findings indicate that engaging young people in a meaningful way will be critical if health improvement efforts are to be realized. We found that a critical service-learning framework that incorporates elements of applied inquiry and critical pedagogy was effective as a health intervention and provided opportunities for action.

AB  - This study investigated whether a particular work-based learning intervention of community service learning (CSL), as compared to paid work experience (PWE), was significantly different across group and time in relation to six dimensions of work performance, five dimensions of social competence, and three dimensions of academic achievement for adolescents with emotional disturbance (ED). Purposive sampling identified fifty-seven 11th and 12th grade ED students from eleven different nonpublic special education programs in Maryland. The instrumentation for this study included (a) a demographic questionnaire, (b) The Work Personality Profile, a situational assessment which measured overall work performance, task orientation, social skills, work motivation, work conformance, and personal presentation, (c) The Walker-McConnell Scale of Social Competence and School Adjustment, a teacher-rated assessment which measured overall social competence, self-control, peer relations, school adjustment, and empathy in adolescents, and (d) The Nelson-Denny Reading Test, an academic achievement test which measured the level of adolescents' ability in overall reading, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Scores were analyzed with MANCOVA and MANOVA procedures. The study found that a significant interaction effect for group and time favored CSL for work motivation, personal presentation, overall social competence, peer relations, and school adjustment. These results have important implications for the use of CSL as a work-based learning intervention given the postsecondary employment concerns for adolescents with ED.

AB  - The purpose of this action research study was to restructure and implement an effective middle school advisory model. This was conducted at a Middle School in Painesville Township, Ohio consisting of approximately 800 students. In order to meet Adequate Yearly Progress and adapt to the changes of the 21st century, a way to help the school progress was recognized by restructuring the 25 minute advisory period. An affective-academic-housekeeping program was applied with the idea of shifting from a heavily social-emotional focus during the first semester to a heavily academic focus during the second. A sample was selected, known as the experimental group, consisting of 250 sixth and seventh grade students. There was a comparison made to a control group within the same school. The study showed positive impacts on attitude, behavior, attendance and academic success.

AB  - The development of civic responsibility is considered to be an important component of healthy adolescent development. However, the study of its development has been relatively neglected and few studies have attempted to ground understanding of its development in a theoretical framework. The present study operationalized civic responsibility as attitudes and behaviors relating to political and community issues that are beneficial to society and compared two theoretical causal models, the social development model (SDM) and a coping-competency model for their predictive value. Gender differences were also assessed. A total of 500 subjects, drawn from a longitudinal study (the Australian Temperament Project), participated in the study, using questionnaire and interview data. Approximately 1 in 5 adolescents actively engaged in behaviors reflecting community civic responsibility and less than 1 in 10 actively participated in the political arena. However, positive levels of social awareness were evident. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the SDM had the most predictive value for political and community civic responsibility. Peer encouragement and peer participation were the most significant predictors. Variables from the coping-competency model played some role in the prediction of community, but not political, civic responsibility. Gender differences in community civic responsibility, but not political civic responsibility, were found. One in two adolescents indicated that they would participate in volunteer work or political activities if more opportunities existed. This suggests the need for greater availability of appropriate community-oriented activities for adolescents. (Contains 9 tables.)

AB  - The article discusses how service learning can be used to teach citizenship and encourage civic participation in students. The author discusses how service learning, in which community activities are integrated into school curricula, can promote civic action and teach students about social problems. She discusses research indicating school-based community projects can improve academic achievement and student motivation as well as change student attitudes regarding civic responsibility. Studies also indicated that activities incorporating political science elements can influence students' political participation. The author comments on the importance of students' participation in selecting activities.

AB  - Scholarship on volunteering has paid insufficient attention to how experiences of volunteering in the past affect current and future participation. The importance of this relationship is emphasized by the introduction of public policies across the globe focusing on national service programmes and community service in schools with the underlying intention of inducing ongoing pro-social behavior. Using the UK longitudinal data, this article analyzes the prevalence of persistent individual volunteering behavior over the life-course, and most importantly, the extent to which past volunteering has a causal influence on current and future participation. Strong evidence of this relationship is provided, suggesting that volunteer-stimulating policy measures—such as the UK government’s National Citizen Service initiative for all young people between 16 and 17 years of age—will have a more profound effect because they do not only affect current volunteering activities but are also likely to induce a permanent change in favor of volunteering.

AB  - In order to prepare students to successfully engage with native speakers and members of heritage language communities both at home and abroad, educators must develop course curricula that emphasize cultural practices, products, perspectives, and comparisons as well as provide students with opportunities to directly apply the skills that they have acquired in the classroom across a range of other settings. This article describes a Culture for the Professions course whose curriculum was based on the four steps of the cultural intelligence model (Earley & Ang, 2003): drive, knowledge, strategy, and action. The study focuses in particular on how students implemented the last two components of the model (strategy and action) by collaborating with local organizations to design and present culture workshops that were specifically tailored to each organization's needs and mission. In addition to benefiting the organizations themselves, data obtained from evaluation rubrics and postworkshop reflections suggest that community culture workshops allow students to become more aware of how culture influences the work of an organization and to develop strategies to bridge cultural differences in the workplace.

AB  - This study examines educators' perspectives of the American Excellence Association (AEA). Using interviews with 16 educators (teachers, counselors, and principals) from 10 high schools, we explored their perceptions regarding AEA's impact on student participants as well as the potential for this type of culturally relevant programming for closing the achievement gap in their respective schools. Results of the analysis suggest that the educators perceive that the AEA fosters an achievement culture and provides participants with a genuine sense of ownership, creating a feeling of belonging and cultural competence, and helping develop critical consciousness through community service. Recommendations are made regarding the use of AEA as a model initiative for transforming the educational experiences of students of color. (Contains 1 table and 1 note.)

AB  - The current study investigated the impact of participation in a service learning course on expressions of integrative complexity in written work. Students were recruited from courses that either contained or did not contain a service learning component. Student essays were collected at predetermined points at the beginning of the semester (Time 1) and at the end of the semester (Time 2). All essays were coded for levels of total complexity and total integration by two independent coders. Essays were analyzed for change over the semester in both forms of complexity for both service learners and non-service learners. Service learners were hypothesized to begin the semester with higher levels of total complexity and total integration and to display a higher rate of increase over the semester when compared to non-service learners. While service learners did display more increase in both forms of complexity over the semester when compared to non-service learners, non-service learners displayed higher initial levels of both forms of complexity. In addition, service learners and non-service learners displayed equal levels of both forms of complexity at Time 2. Service learners reported higher increases in motivation to help others after completing the semester than did non-service learners. This finding converges with previous service learning research.

AB  - Describes the Living, Learning, Working (LLW) program that combines social interest, school success skills, and service learning designed to be used with 4th and 5th grader students who later help younger students. The objective of the program is to enhance listening, attending, empathy, social problem solving, and contributing skills. Several ways for school counselors to use the program are suggested. The authors describe the tell-show-do-coach method for teaching the skills associated with social interest and school success. The 12-session group program is delineated in 3 phases: Working Together (Sessions 1–3); Learning Together (Session 4–8); and Living Together (Sessions 9–12). Key strategies of the program are using stories, teaching story structure, role play, and modeling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purposes of the study were to (a) investigate the model of instruction middle school students received through a service-learning project and students' understanding of the social issue being studied, (b) determine whether certain variables were related to students' understanding of the social issue being studied, and (c) learn which instructional components of the project the students considered most meaningful. The findings could focus the activity of teachers on instructional practices to achieve desired affective and academic goals for middle school students. Also, the researcher hoped to add to the literature on the topic of service-learning that discusses how effective integration of service into the content-area curriculum can be ensured. The study population comprised 524 public middle school students in a suburban Class B district in central Michigan. The sample included 438 students who completed a pre inventory, 403 students who completed a post inventory, 22 students interviewed by the researcher, and 63 students who elected to participate in off-campus service visits. Two slightly different models of service-learning instruction were studied in an effort to identify differences in subject-matter achievement and variables that might contribute to the differences. A locally developed instrument was used to measure (a) subject-matter achievement, (b) number of extracurricular activities students participated in, (c) students' involvement in the food drive, (d) students' exposure to media information, and (e) which activities related to the food drive were most meaningful to the students. Interviews were conducted with students to gather data to support or contradict the inventory data. The statistical tests and interview data support the following major findings: (1) Students participating in off-campus service visits appeared to be better informed about the social issue of hunger than non-service-visit students. (2) Students receiving the content-integrated model of instruction scored significantly higher on the subject-matter portion of the post inventory than students receiving the isolated model of instruction. (3) The instructional components considered most meaningful to students were those activities that resulted in an externally valued product--that is, something that provides validation of the value of one's activities.

AB  - This quasi-experimental study examined the impact of service-learning on academic achievement of New Jersey public high school students. Average standardized test score were gathered for the High School Proficiency Achievement (HSPA) and the SAT test. Statistics addressing student mobility and student participation in SAT testing were also gathered. A survey disseminated by the State Department of Education was utilized to identify schools with service-learning programming and those without. The sample of service-learning schools included both schools that indicated that more than 50% of the student population was involved in service-learning programs and schools that were nominated to take part in the National Service-Learning Leader Schools program. These schools were matched to more traditional schools that do not employ service-learning programming. Analysis of Covariance tests demonstrated significant variance in Community Service-Learning Schools mean test scores with the Community Service-Learning Schools mean scores found to be higher than those of Traditional Schools. Significant interactions between SES groupings and the CSL School variable were also noted in some cases. The highest socioeconomic grouping revealed the highest means and the lowest socioeconomic grouping labeled revealed the highest mean differences between CSL and traditional schools. In both cases, the middle socioeconomic grouping showed a small but higher mean score for Traditional Schools when compared to schools with CSL programming. When the same statistical tests were performed on mean test scores of New Jersey Service-Learning Leader Schools (NJ Leader) and Non-Leader Schools, a statistically significant difference was found in the verbal and math portion of the HSPA, the verbal and math portion of the SAT, and total SAT scores. In all instances the NJ Leader Schools outscored the Non-Leader Schools. Nine of the ten Null Hypotheses were rejected as they relate to the three subsidiary questions.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between the occurrence of critical leadership in students and service learning in the classroom. The primary research question for the study was: How do students and teachers from a service learning environment perceive leadership? Five supporting questions were analyzed in order to discuss the primary research question: (1) Do students and teachers define leadership within a critical context? (2) Do students and teachers believe that critical leadership arises out of taking civic responsibility? (3) Do students and teachers think that leadership is learnable? (4) What is the relationship between service learning in the classroom and teachers' perceptions of leadership? (5) What is the relationship between service learning in the classroom and students' perceptions of leadership? Data were collected using a three-tiered approach. Quantitative data were collected through student questionnaires. Qualitative data were gathered through extensive classroom observation and interviews. To the extent that it was possible within the school setting, the four classroom teachers within the service learning research environment actively promoted all of the ideas of critical leadership discussed in the literature review. All four teachers believed that leadership was important to learn. Frequent opportunities were provided for students to take a primary role in decision making processes and to exercise leadership in student-owned gatherings. Teachers promoted the idea of each individual's participation within the classroom community. Students generally subscribed to the elements of critical leadership as evidenced through the research. None of the students involved in the study indicated that they perceived leadership as a strictly hierarchical role. All interviewed students stated their belief that everyone has the ability to learn how to be a leader. All students discussed the importance of morality in leading. Student perceptions of themselves as leaders rose from less than 5% to 70% during seven and one half months of observation.

AB  - The popularity of service learning programs in public schools has increased in the past decade. In many cases, the practice of service learning has proceeded without the benefit of formative feedback from science. Researchers are beginning to establish both socio-affective and academic benefits of service learning with secondary school students. Research is sparse, however, when it comes to elementary school students. Educational research must address how service learning is beneficial to young students if solid arguments for its continuation in elementary schools are to be made. This dissertation sought to add to that body of knowledge by examining whether engaging elementary school students in a service learning program might increase their sense of community, internal locus of control orientations, and self-efficacy beliefs regarding ability to influence community. A pretest-posttest control group design was employed, utilizing a multiple analysis of covariance statistical procedure. The experimental treatment was participation in a service learning program. The sample consisted of 38 third and fourth grade students who attended a small, rural elementary school. A third and a fourth grade classroom were randomly assigned to the treatment or wait-list control conditions. Dependent measures were the Sense of Community Scale for Children, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Children-Revised, and the Influence on Community Scale for Children. Multiple analysis of covariance results were not statistically significant. Follow-up analyses of covariance to test an expectation based on treatment observations regarding the differential impact of treatment were nonsignificant, as well. Although not statistically significant, the fourth grade treatment classroom scored higher than its control group counterpart on all outcomes. These results suggested a trend for the fourth grade treatment students to make greater gains on dependent variables than the third grade treatment students. Possible explanations of this trend are presented, including information gathered through structured treatment observations that indicated a higher amount of reflection activity in the fourth grade treatment classroom. Some support was gained for the importance of reflection as a best practice in service learning. Design, statistical, and measurement limitations are discussed in detail, and implications for future research and practice in service learning are offered.

AB  - Service-learning is the combination of traditional teaching methods with field-based learning and critical reflection (Hurd, 2008) and is popular in first-year composition (Deans, 2001). However, academic research on service-learning in first-year composition is relatively scarce and the most frequently-cited scholarship is at least a decade old (Adler-Kassner, Crooks & Watters, 1997; Deans, 2001; Haussamen, 1997). This study seeks to contribute to the scholarship on service-learning in first-year composition by exploring how stakeholders, including the instructor, the students, and the community partner, perceive the project’s purposes and outcomes.

AB  - This study explored the potential of a service-learning program to cultivate positive developmental strengths among Latino/a youth participating in a school-based program in Los Angles County. Youth (N=112) in grades 5–12, who were primarily from low SES backgrounds, participated in an environmental and humanitarian education program, the Jane Goodall Institute's, Roots & Shoots (R&S) program. Three positive youth development (PYD) variables, including civic responsibility, ethnic identity, and connection to nature were assessed before and after participation. Challenges in program implementation and data collection resulted in a small subset of participants that completed measures at the pre and posttest (n = 22). Within this group, no changes from pre to posttest emerged, yet the analysis was underpowered due to the small sample. Within the larger data set, no gender or ethnic differences emerged. All three PYD variables were related. Connection to nature was positively associated with SES and negatively associated with age. Results and implications for future research are discussed, as are issues related to academic-community research collaborations.

AB  - Service learning has been found to be a potentially powerful dropout prevention tool. Service learning combines community service with learning activities. Participating students must be engaged in significant, well-planned, and genuine service. Second, they must reflect on their experiences of serving others to ensure a complete learning experience. These requirements are vital to a successful service learning experience. Many favorable outcomes occur in each of the following developmental areas through participation in service learning activities: personal growth; social growth; intellectual growth; citizenship; and preparation for the world of work. Service learning can be integrated into the organizational structure of a school through four progressively complex levels of implementation: extracurricular; curricular unit; mandatory or elective courses; and school-wide integration. Essential components of service learning include preparation, action, and reflection. The service learning continuum can be implemented at all grade levels. Research has shown that the integration of service learning into the school curriculum is an extremely effective strategy in meeting the many developmental needs of all students. Service learning is a teaching methodology that revitalizes the classroom and provides the kind of learning and experiences students need to lead a successful life. (ABL)

AB  - International immersion learning experiences intend to increase students’ awareness and understanding of the world and other cultures. However, empirical support for global learning and psychosocial outcomes is mixed. Using hierarchical linear modeling, this study examined the longitudinal trajectories of a global learning outcome (international interests; AGLII; Musil, 2006) and a psychosocial outcome (psychological well-being; MHI; Veit & Ware, 1983) for students (N = 147; 87% female; 72% Caucasian) who participated in a short-term (13 to 62 days) global service learning immersion to one of 15 countries (Brazil, Cambodia, China, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Malawi, Russia, Rwanda, Thailand, Uganda, Ukraine, or Vietnam). Global service learning is a specific type of international immersion learning focused not on language acquisition, necessarily, but rather on integrating travel and community service. Additionally, this study focused on examining the moderating effects of sociocultural adaptation (SCAS; Ward & Kennedy, 1999) and cultural distance (estimated using the Gini coefficient, an economic measure of income inequality within a country; The World Bank Group, 2014) on outcome trajectories. Survey data was collected from participants at pre-departure and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after return. No significant longitudinal trajectory was indicated for international interests, while a significant cubic function was indicated for psychological well-being (β10 = -.376, p < .001; β 20 = .062, p < .001; β30 = -.003, p = .002). For both outcomes, pre-departure scores significantly impacted intercept (AGLII, β03 = .564, p < .001; MHI, β01 = .527, p < .001). Sociocultural adaptation significantly moderated the curvilinear trajectory of psychological well-being (β11 = .074, p = .004; β21 = -.006, p = .007). Cultural distance had no significant impact on either outcome; the Gini coefficient may not be a sufficient indicator of cultural distance. Expected growth in global learning outcomes was not demonstrated by these findings; accurate measurement may have been an issue and should be a focus of future research. These findings support the wide-spread notion of re-entry friction; future research should aim to replicated these findings with other types of international immersion learning programs.

AB  - This report describes the Remote School, a "center for student leadership" in the high country of the Victorian Alps (Australia), and presents findings from an ongoing evaluation. This state-supported residential program addresses the needs of year-9 students on the threshold of adulthood and seeks to harness their energy in positive ways. The school serves only year-9 students during a one-term (9-week) residential program. During the term, a mixed-gender group of 40 students undertakes an experientially based curriculum designed to stimulate leadership ideas and ideals that support enhanced self-concept development. Teams of students design community service projects to be completed on return to their home communities. A key program feature is the use of laptop computers and the Internet to enhance learning. Evaluation findings presented here focus on technology use and student self-concept. Teacher and student surveys covered (1) teachers' use of various learning technologies, confidence with the technologies, and related professional development needs; (2) students' use of computers and the Internet in school, daily engagement in various types of technological activities, attitudes toward computers, and confidence in own abilities to use computers and to teach others to use them; and (3) students' self-efficacy and self-evaluation with regard to 18 "enterprise capabilities."

AB  - A critical exploration of the meaning and function of community is the focus of this curriculum unit. It is proposed that students develop projects that are designed to contribute to a community in which they are involved, positing that the leadership and networking skills these students develop over the course of the semester provide them with confidence and direction for the adult world they are about to enter. The unit presents a course overview, student objectives, methodology and assessment materials, a section on student projects and whole class activities, final student presentations, a section on course content, notes for the teacher on how to teach the course, and a contemporary problems project list.

AB  - Since the NASSP initiatives of the 1970s, service learning activities have prospered in many schools, and mandatory community service has either been adopted or is being considered by many state and local school systems. With passage of the National and Community Service Act (1990), both service learning and full-time stipended youth service are national policy. (MLH)

AB  - The notion of democracy occupies a privileged place in our society. Educators and policymakers are increasingly pursuing a broad variety of programs that aim to promote democracy through civic education, service learning, and other pedagogies. The nature of their underlying beliefs, however, differ. For some, a commitment to democracy is associated with liberal notions of freedom, while for others democracy is primarily about equality of opportunity. For some, civil society is the key, while others place their hope for social change in healthy free markets. For some, good citizens in a democracy volunteer, while for others they take active parts in political processes by voting, forming committees, or protesting. ?Educating the ?Good? Citizen" calls attention to this spectrum of ideas about what good citizenship is and what good citizens do. We underscore the political implications of education for democracy and suggest that the narrow and often ideologically conservative conception of citizenship embedded in many current efforts at teaching for democracy reflects not arbitrary choices but rather political choices with political consequences. In this article, we detail three conceptions of the ?good? citizen: personally responsible, participatory, and justice oriented. These emerged from our analysis of both democratic theory and our two year study of educational programs that aim to promote democracy. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data from two of the programs we studied, we argue that these three conceptions embody significantly different beliefs regarding the capacities and commitments citizens need in order for democracy to flourish; and they carry significantly different implications for pedagogy, curriculum, evaluation, and educational policy. We conclude that politics and the interests of varied groups are often deeply embedded in the ways we conceptualize, implement, and study efforts to educate for democracy.

AB  - Environmental literacy is becoming an increasingly important part of national and state curriculum standards. Scientists can assist teachers by providing citizen-science research opportunities and other educational outreach programs for local students. Middle school students from Summit Charter School in Cashiers, Jackson County, NC, in conjunction with a roadside litter cleanup community-service project, assisted researchers from the Highlands Biological Station who were examining discarded bottles as a source of smallmammal mortality. Students sorted and weighed recyclable materials and inspected open bottles for small-mammal remains. They collected approximately 141 kg of trash along 2 roads near their school, 59.4% of which was recyclable material consisting primarily of glass and plastic bottles. Students removed 8 specimens from 5 bottles, including 6 Blarina brevicauda (Northern Short-tailed Shrew), 1 Sorex cinereus (Masked Shrew), and 1 S. fumeus (Smoky Shrew). Students learned to distinguish small-mammal skulls based on dentition and other cranial characteristics while using dichotomous keys, and reconstructed skeletons using anatomical diagrams traditionally used for owl-pellet dissections. Educational programs that incorporate immersive, hands-on, real-world experiences, especially those that use the local community as a framework, can enhance students' appreciation for the natural world and provide the knowledge and skills they will require to make informed environmental decisions as future community leaders.

AB  - Experiential learning is used to address the abstractness of classroom discussion and motivate long-lasting learning. The aims of this study were to measure the effects of a tourism service-learning course on the development of students’ generic competencies and to evaluate the influence of experiential learning on hospitality and tourism education. Preproject and postproject self-administered surveys and postproject reflective journals were completed by students enrolled on a service-learning course entitled Ecotourism in Rural and Developing Regions. The majority of the students were found to value the service-learning course, particularly a service project conducted outside the classroom setting, which made them aware of the needs of the underprivileged within the service community. The students also showed significant improvements in their generic competencies, specifically their teamwork and sense of social responsibility.

AB  - In 2003, China's Ministry of Education mandated environmental education in all subjects at all levels in Chinese public schools and explicitly encouraged teachers to engage their students in hands-on learning in their local communities. However, a number of obstacles--including an intense preoccupation with test scores and student safety--make this difficult to achieve. This article presents an unusual exception, an initiative in the Chinese city of Kunming with an approach that closely resembles North American place- and community-based education. This initiative trained and placed primary school students in a local museum as volunteer docents, where they interpreted exhibits on environmental themes and local history and culture for museum visitors. The article begins with a brief description of environmental education's circumstances in urban China and the origins of this "Little Volunteer" initiative. The article then presents an assessment of the initiative's outcomes and analyzes its implications for environmental education practice more broadly.

AB  - Achieving the kind of balance that encourages all children to learn, work, and contribute to their fullest potential has been a continuing challenge as the world grows more complex and our communities more fragmented. Aspects of education that have been referred to as character education, service learning, citizenship education, and emotional intelligence can all be expressed in the single term "social-emotional learning," and it is this form of education, when added to academic learning, that provides educators with the possibility of capturing the balance children need. This monograph provides a rationale and framework for combining academic and social-emotional learning into educational policy and objectives. The monograph highlights research findings, practical applications, and suggested readings for the following strategies: (1) learning requires caring; (2) teach everyday life-skills; (3) link social-emotional instruction to other school services; (4) use goal-setting to focus instruction; (5) use varied instructional procedures; (6) promote community service to build empathy; (7) involve parents; (8) build social-emotional skills gradually and systematically; (9) prepare and support staff well; and (10) evaluate what you do. (Contains 39 references, and a listing of related resources including international Web sites.) (HTH)

AB  - All over the world, educators are recognizing that creating a school culture and climate that genuinely engages and supports all students is essential to increasing students' achievement and preventing students from dropping out. Research supports the view that schools must encourage students to express themselves--clearly and often--and be places where students feel listened to and understood. Under such circumstances, a dynamic ethic of social participation is created that begins in the classroom and extends to the school building, the surrounding environs, and outward into the community. Fundamentally, lasting learning is the result of acts of co-creation in caring contexts, and that is what the pedagogy of student voice provides. Combined with efforts to create a safe, supporting, caring, and challenging school climate and explicitly promote students' social-emotional and character development (SECD) competencies, activities that enhance student voice and engagement are among the most powerful tools to reduce the drop-out rate and close the academic and opportunity gaps that still plague too many schools. Included in this article are the top six activities to enhance student voice.

AB  - This study examined a causal relationship between service-learning participation and academic achievement of 9th grade students in math and science courses. The central purpose of the study was to examine the impact of service-learning participation on students’ academic outcomes, and to determine if this impact was consistent after controlling for the socioeconomic status (SES) of the student. The participants in this study were from the base year data of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). For this study, 15,058 students identified as being enrolled in mathematics and science classes were selected. Quantitative methods were used to analyze cross-sectional data from the HSLS:09 study. The initial findings from this study suggest that service-learning participation was consistent in student’s academic achievement of all students regardless of socioeconomic status.

AB  - This research explores the relationship of community service-learning to empathy in elementary school children. The study also investigates empathy and its relationship to concern for others in elementary school children. Surveys were administered to 171 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-graders from three Nashville-area Catholic schools, including a demographic questionnaire, the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents, and the Concern for Others Scale. Different characteristics of community service-learning were investigated in relation to the empathy levels of the participants. Characteristics investigated included the amount of time spent participating in community service, the number of settings in which community service was performed, the type of community service, parental involvement in community service, emotions related to participating in community service, and future plans related to community service. Significant relationships existed between the number of settings in which community service was performed and Empathy scores, parental involvement and Empathy scores, emotions related to community service and Empathy scores, and future plans related to community service and Empathy scores. A significant positive relationship also existed between Empathy scores and Concern for Others Scores. The present study revealed that various characteristics of community service-learning are significantly related to empathy levels in elementary school children.

AB  - This research explores the impact of a service-learning project on the attitudes of the student participants. The study also investigates the impact of a service-learning project on the sense of efficacy and autonomy of the participants. Survey packets were administered to forty-three 3rd through 8th graders from a Nashville-area private school divided into two groups distinguished by an intervention. Group one participated in a Disability Awareness Program (DAP) alone, and group two participated in a DAP coupled with a service-learning project. Data was collected pre- and post-intervention for both groups. Analyses of the data revealed that group one experienced significant increases in positive attitudes towards people with disabilities compared to group two. Group two reported decreases in positive attitudes towards people with disabilities after participation in a DAP followed by a service-learning project, though the change was not significant. These results were the opposite of the anticipated results stated in hypothesis one. There were no other differences between the two groups in either the area of efficacy or autonomy. Post-hoc analyses produced no significant results when gender and age differences were investigated.

AB  - This study follows the evolution of a single biology course designed for non-science majors. In its original design, the course used only traditional pedagogical techniques, such as lecture and textbook homework assignments. Over several iterations of the course, the class combined problem-based learning (PBL) and service learning to better support student knowledge. For this study, our goal was for students to learn biology concepts as they engaged in a lake cleanup project within the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Data sources consisted of pretest, posttest, and final exam scores to assess learning. The results suggest the combination of PBL and service learning led to gains in student learning.

AB  - Given the growing emphasis on internationalization and the requisite intercultural skills and temperament necessary in a global society, this study examines the relationship between precollege engagement and entering dispositions on a developmentally based set of global perspective outcomes. Based on a multi-institutional sample of 3,131 entering, first-year students, the results demonstrate significant relationships between students' precollege engagement and the knowledge, affect, and social responsibility dimensions of the Global Perspective Inventory. In particular, results linked precollege involvement in curricular and cocurricular opportunities focused on learning about difference, global issues, and leadership or service opportunities to three dimensions of the inventory, highlighting the influence of such involvement on development across cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal domains.

AB  - Many schools use service-learning on their campus to enhance their classroom content. According to Learn and Serve Clearinghouse, "Service-learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility and strengthen communities." There are several projects that can be implemented on the high school campus that can promote service-learning. At Raymond S. Kellis High School in Glendale, Arizona, students have undertaken projects in service-learning to help feed the less fortunate in their communities, and to install solar panels in the school's student-run store.

AB  - The Community-Based Education Model (CBEM) at Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS) in New Mexico was studied to determine the elements that contribute to its success and that may be replicated in other community education projects. The CBEM engages students and tribal communities in issues related to their environment, natural resources, and health in an attempt to stimulate high school student interest and motivation in math and science. CBEM is a partnership among students, SFIS, the Pueblo community, business, and government that meets the request of the Pueblo governors to educate students in the skills needed in the outside world and in their own traditions. Pueblo students are learning mainstream skills (math and environmental science), and they are interacting with mainstream organizations. Their work is rooted in the Pueblo community through local field experience programs on water quality, and connections are made to Pueblo culture through Pueblo community members. Program strengths include a committed, knowledgeable, energetic staff that shares a common educational philosophy supported by educational research and Pueblo ideas; a program that is responsive to Pueblo culture, traditions, and needs; cutting-edge technology available for student and community use; increased student motivation to learn environmental science; networks between Native and mainstream science and technology organizations; and excellent documentation of the process behind the model program. Recommendations for program improvement and replication are listed. (Contains 21 references, a table displaying CBEM themes, and figures depicting the model.) (TD)

AB  - The authors describe environmental service-learning (SL) programs in Florida high schools and colleges through a statewide program census that explored (a) academic, service, and reflection program features; (b) effects of Furco's SL outcome domains on student outcomes; and (c) program partnerships. The results of the study reveal that secondary schools and colleges in Florida practice environmental SL in a variety of ways. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for environmental SL and offer recommendations for further research and educational practice.

AB  - Service learning has been defined as the integration of service with academic growth. It is a method through which young people learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences. Service learning programs are individualized and unique, and to duplicate one program or to expect the same effects from one community to another is nearly impossible. Service learning programs bring many benefits to students. Descriptions of eight service learning programs in the five northwest states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington show some of the possibilities available for service learning. All share the goal of connecting students with the community around them. Included with the description of each program is contact information and tips for those looking to implement service projects in their schools. The booklet also contains a list of steps in establishing a service learning program. An appendix contains safety guidelines for planning service learning projects. Regional and state contacts are also listed. (Contains 20 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this 3-year study is to assess how using what students (n =203) learn in the classroom during internships influences their attitudes toward certain civic engagement issues. Results demonstrate that having more opportunities to use what they learn while on the job significantly predicts who the students believe benefit most (themselves, supervisor, the organization, the community, target public/s), how valued they believe their contributions are to their employers as well as to them personally, and career choices. Recommendations for public relations educators are suggested.

AB  - The Learn and Serve Grant Program was designed to support schools and community-based organizations (CBOs) that engage children and adolescents in service activities linked to the school curriculum that address real community needs. An evaluation covered 93 Pennsylvania schools and CBOs that received funding to design and implement programs. Process, participant, and outcome evaluations were performed. Findings indicated that the proportion of minigrants to disseminator grants, 85 to 15 percent, preserved a balance between developing and mature programs. Grant distribution by region generally followed the demographics of population distribution. Rural, suburban, and urban areas were generally within a few percentage points of each other. With regard to distribution by recipients, high schools predominated. The relationship between the curriculum and service could be enriched if the process were accompanied by organizational commitment, service learning variety, and a continuum of curriculum and service integration. The most effective coordinators did the following: created opportunities to promote service learning as a core value; met community needs by adopting appropriate service activities; developed a strong communication network; and maintained updated records. Characteristics of successful collaborations were as follows: ongoing, thorough in preparing participants to serve, frequent and clear communication, supported by a strong advisory board, and persistent.

AB  - This dissertation examined the perceptions of Washington state educational leaders on character education through student leadership development, citizenship training, and service learning in public high schools. Changes throughout previous generations have resulted in varying viewpoints on character education in the overall strategy of meeting educational objectives. The literature suggested that it was important for any character development program to be an explicit, dynamic, and school wide mission in which the educational leaders and the supported community were in agreement on the need for character education. The research questions addressed the perceptions of the study participants on: (1) the relationships between student leadership development, citizenship training, and service learning; (2) the role public education should have in student leadership development, citizenship training, and service learning; (3) the need for student leadership development, and service learning for all students; (4) the responsibility of the public school system to produce good citizens; and (5) the responsibility of the public school system to prepare all students for leadership roles. The participants were from a random sample of educational leaders at the state, district and high school level, in Washington State. Data were collected about eighteen issues related to character education through student leadership development, citizenship training, and service learning at the secondary level and analyzed using descriptive statistics and other statistical tests such as ANOVA, Fisher's PLSD, and chi-square to determine significant differences among the perceptions of the participants. Participants agreed that student leadership development, citizenship training and service learning should be provided for all students. Although most indicated that leadership development should not take priority over citizenship training or service learning, leadership development was described as a major component of both citizenship and service learning programs. Based on these and other findings, one of the recommendations was a long-term study to determine (1) whether one program is more appropriate than the other, (2) the possibility of effectively teaching students one without the other, and (3) whether character education results in long term moral and ethical behavior.

AB  - This paper explores the foundations and possibilities of service learning at the elementary education level. Teachers can utilize the tools of service learning to enrich their students' academic and personal lives, in addition to contributing to the community. Service learning is an approach to education in which students actually meet community needs and have a voice in the planning and execution of the project. This paper is divided into the following sections: (1) "Introduction"; (2) "So, What Is Service Learning?"; (3) "Why Should Students Participate in Service Learning?"; (4) "What Is a Framework of Service Learning?"; (5) "How Are Service Learning Projects Organized?"; (6) "Preparation"; (7) "Service"; (8) "Reflection (Before, During and After Service)"; and (9) "What Role Can Service Learning Play in Elementary Schools?"

AB  - Service-learning integrates community service into a credit-earning course to enrich the learning experience and pair practice with theory in some content area. Linguistics courses offer tremendous potential for service-learning because there are a variety of ways in which language-related theory can be put into practice. This paper outlines the development of a service-learning curriculum for linguistics courses. While examples come from a project where students tutored adult second language learners of English, the activities in this paper extend well to other linguistics courses. Reflection is essential to service-learning, so necessary background and examples of it as a structured learning tool appear here. A second assessment tool, an anonymous online survey taken before and after tutoring, was used to explore any impact on language and diversity attitudes. More generally, service-learning has the potential to positively affect career development, to generate a sense of civic engagement, to facilitate greater understanding of other cultures and races and to make a difference in local communities.

AB  - This study contributes to the service learning (SL) literature by providing new empirical evidence of learning from a problem-based SL research project conducted in a developmental research methods course. Two sections of the course taught in a traditional manner were compared to two sections of the course taught with an integrated SL project involving a local Boys & Girls Club. Pre- and posttest scores of the groups were compared in regard to content knowledge, civic engagement, and perceptions of the course. Results indicated that the SL students outperformed the control courses in learning outcomes. Civic engagement did not significantly change over the course of the semester. Student preference data indicated that most enjoyed the SL course, found it helpful, and thought it contributed to their understanding of the course material. The findings are related to past research and theoretical underpinnings that support SL.

AB  - An urban elementary school in the city of Phoenix showed little evidence of using active learning even though active learning is a best practice to create engaged citizens. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether participating in a 3-week service-learning project improved civic engagement among at-risk elementary students. The theoretical foundation for this study was the constructivist learning theory, which states that students learn and create meaning by being active participants in their own learning. The research questions asked if completing a 3-week service-learning project showed a statistically significant difference in civic engagement for at-risk tutorial students at the school and whether there was a statistically significant grade level interaction effect. The Civic Responsibility Survey for K-12 Students Engaged in Service was used to gather quantitative data for this quasi-experimental design. The sample consisted of 162 students and was limited to the number of students enrolled in first through fourth grades in the 2016-2017 school year. Descriptive statistics and an analysis of covariance was conducted to determine the effect of participation in a service-learning project on reported civic engagement outcomes. There was no statistically significant difference in civic engagement after students participated in a service-learning project compared to students who did not participate. There was, however, a statistically significant difference in civic engagement scores between Grade 3 and Grade 1 and Grade 3 and Grade 4. A 3-day professional development was created for teachers as a result of this study. This may influence positive social change by creating active learning experiences for students at the school, which may lead to greater civic engagement, improved teacher-student relationships, and higher academic achievement.

AB  - Objectives. In this study we tested the ability of mass media interventions to enhance the efficacy of school cigarette smoking prevention programs. Methods. For 4 years, students in one pair of communities received media interventions and school programs that had common educational objectives. Students in a matched pair of communities received only the school programs. The combined cohort of 5458 students was surveyed at baseline in grades 4, 5, and 6 and was followed up annually for 4 years. Results. Significant reductions in reported smoking along with consistent effects on targeted mediating variables, were observed for the media-and-school group. For cigarettes per week the reduction was 41% (2.6 vs 4.4); for smoking cigarettes yesterday the reduction was 34% (8.6% vs 13.1%); and for smoking in the past week the reduction was 35% (12.8% vs 19.8%). No effects were observed for substance use behaviors not targeted by the interventions. Conclusions. These results provide evidence that mass media interventions are effective in preventing cigarette smoking when they are carefully targeted at high-risk youths and share educational objectives with school programs.

AB  - A two-group pretest–post-test quasi-experiment was conducted to analyze the impact of curriculum infusion of the social norms approach on students’ alcohol perceptions and behaviors. This study extended previous research by examining two types of curriculum infusion, information only (IO) and service learning (SL). Also, owing to variations in drinking behavior between women and men, sex differences in IO and SL were assessed. In support of previous research, curriculum infusion significantly reduced participants’ misperceptions of campus alcohol use. There were no differences found between the IO and SL groups. However, further analysis revealed differences based on participants’ sex. Men in the SL group significantly reduced their drinking behavior. Since men tend to drink more than women and because heavy drinkers are typically more resistant to alcohol interventions, the SL results have practical implications for instructional communication with this demographic.

AB  - In Florida, the Learn & Serve America program has fostered evolutionary, perhaps revolutionary, changes in teaching and learning. Data from 1995-96 Florida Learn & Serve grantees mirror the positive results of the previous academic year. By heavy majorities (62% to 82%), participating students showed improvements in attendance, conduct, and academic performance. Data consistency over a two-year period suggests these outcomes may be replicated elsewhere. (MLH)

AB  - More than 230 educators from 125 schools and communities around the country gathered for the national conference of the Foundation for Excellent Schools to exchange ideas and strategies for educational improvement. The conference theme, "Achieving Educational Excellence through Collaboration," was featured in sessions exploring the possibilities of partnerships in education. U.S. Secretary of Education, Richard W. Riley, discussed school and community partnerships in education as a growing trend. Other themes that were stressed in panel sessions and in individual presentations were: (1) team building and leadership as the building blocks of change; (2) the power of partnerships; (3) parents as partners; (4) the collegiate connection; (5) bringing businesses on board; (6) promoting community ties; (7) reaching out and up through service learning and peer relationships; (8) finding funding; and (9) connecting through creativity. Experiences in an Oregon school district and the exchange of experiences among New York City, Alabama, Massachusetts, and Vermont teachers are also described. (SLD)

AB  - Service learning is an accepted practice in many middle and high schools as a means to develop empathy for others and promote character. In elementary classrooms service learning may be considered a one time a year occurrence and carried out as a school-wide project. This article addresses a more integrated approach to service learning, wherein children can participate in a year long approach to contributing to their community. Teachers direct them in making connections to the local community while at the same time developing life long habits of participation and service.

AB  - This study was designed to determine if a mandatory high school service-learning program was having the intended effect on student civic attitudes and skills. Using a pretest and post course survey design, the study sought to determine if the service-learning instructional programs have a positive impact on student attitudes towards people in their school and community, attitudes towards civic involvement, issues awareness, self-perceived leadership, and problem solving skills. The study also examined whether there are any differences in the impact on students attitudes between high schools using the Issues Based Curriculum and a high school that is using a less formal approach. The study was conducted during the fall semester of 2003. Study participants included all ninth grade students (n=212) at three high schools enrolled in the government course in which students were required to complete the high school portion of Maryland's service-learning requirement. A quantitative analysis of the matched pretest and posttest mean scores was conducted for the Civic Attitudes and Skill Questionnaire (CASQ) and each of its seven subscales. The study found student attitudes as measured by the CASQ changed significantly after completing their mandatory service-learning projects in the district. Examination of subscale data revealed that student mean scores improved significantly in Diversity Attitudes and Political Awareness. The Issues Based Curriculum had a significant positive effect on student attitudes. Neither race nor gender were found to have a significant effect on changes in student mean responses on the CASQ after completing their mandatory service-learning projects.

AB  - Schools across the country continue to search for ways to most effectively meet the needs of all students, including those who are at-risk for dropping out of school. Effective and engaging instructional strategies are sought to promote student success and academic performance. This study found multiple qualitative studies as well as perceptual and survey data in its review of the literature that supported the effectiveness of service learning in increasing student achievement. The following four specific areas of academic performance in this study were as follows: attendance, grade point average, incidents of discipline, and drop-out rate. The purpose and significance of this study was to determine if empirical quantitative evidence supported the body of qualitative and perceptual research found in the literature review, specifically for an at-risk population in an alternative school setting. The study proceeded to utilize a MANOVA test design to determine if a significant relationship existed between the dependent variable of participation in service learning and the four independent variables of attendance, grade point average, discipline incidents, and drop-out rate. A total of 150 students were involved in the longitudinal study spanning nine years since the inception of the program in this particular alternative high school setting. Results of this study indicated that no significant relationship existed between participation in service learning and greater or more positive academic performance in the areas at attendance, discipline rate, or drop-out rate. Results indicated significance in the area of grade point average but with caution due to an assumption of equal variance being violated as found in the Levene’s Test results. The findings reveal that service learning may be a significantly effective strategy to increase student achievement in the area of grade point average within this population. More research is recommended in the study of empirical student performance data instead of research designed around perceptions and anecdotal findings. Research in this area with a larger sample size across multiple populations may or may not produce different results. The many external variables of students’ lives beyond the control of the school setting also contribute to students’ performance and these limitations are very hard for a researcher to control. This study attempted to lessen the limitations by comparing like students during the school year when the control group was participating in service learning as compared to the controlled match response group who did not participate in service learning. In summary, this study did not find significant relationships between students who participated in service learning as compared to those students who did not in the above mentioned academic areas. The one exception was a possible significant relationship in the area of increased grade point average for those students who did participate in service learning. These results do not mean that service learning is an ineffective strategy; however, the results do not indicate, according to this study, that service learning should become more than an elective course. The results don’t indicate a strong reason to require service learning for all students as a way to increase all areas of academic performance.

AB  - A growing number of K-12 schools are encouraging students to provide service to the community as part of their overall educational experience. While a few studies have explored the educational outcomes of service activities, these studies, for the most part, have been limited in scope and have not produced definitive findings. This study utilized 11 instruments and protocols designed to measure high school students' development in six educational domains: academic, career, ethical, social, personal, and civic development. The study examined differences in educational outcomes between a group of students who performed service (n = 344) and a group of students who did not (n = 185). Based on data from a 41-item pre-test/post-test survey that measured student attitudes across the six domains, ANCOVA's revealed that for each of the six domains, the post-test score means were significantly higher for the service group than for the no service group. However, the effect sizes within each domain were small and the domain reliabilities of the survey were low. Qualitative analyses, based on additional data from students, teachers, and community agency representatives also found discernible differences in outcomes between students who performed service and students who did not. The qualitative analysis revealed that for each of the six educational domains, the service group data tended to contain more elaborate and profound discussions about student development than did data from the no service group. Using the same sample, the study also compared the outcomes of students participating in different types of service programs--community service, service-learning, and internship. The ANCOVA conducted for each domain found significant differences between certain program types for the academic, career, ethical, and social domains. However, no firm conclusions could be drawn. The qualitative analysis did not find any discernible differences in outcomes among the three service groups. The qualitative analysis did identify several common themes that appeared among the three service groups: (1) individual students' interests and abilities played a crucial role in the outcomes students gained; (2) students were empowered by meaningful service experiences; (3) a student's belief in a service activity's "cause" influenced the outcomes; (4) the schools' perceptions of service influenced how students approached their service activities; and (5) service programs provided opportunities to establish various collaborative units. The study's limitations included researcher selection and sample self-selection biases, minimal controls for potential differences between non-equivalent groups, and faulty assumptions regarding independence of the educational domains. The researcher recommends that research of service programs move away from trying to determine direct links between students' participation in service and outcomes in the six educational domains. The researcher concluded that the K-12 service field needs to develop a theory that focuses specifically on service and its implications for students' educational development.

AB  - A study compared the occupational preferences of middle-school girls and boys and examined whether service learning influences students' career interests. The sample included 717 middle school students at pretesting and 583 students at posttesting. Boys comprised 49 percent of the sample and girls 51 percent. Students attended five different service learning schools located in or near New York City. Students worked at these types of service sites: preschools, elementary schools, senior centers, nursing homes, environmental and community projects, school-based projects, offices, and libraries. During 1992-95, the Student Service Learning Survey was completed by students before and after their service learning experience. It assessed students' beliefs and attitudes about service learning and school in three areas: psychosocial, job-related, and academic. Gender differences were found in the areas of sports, arts, medicine, and education. Service learning seemed related to girls' interests in the field of education but could not be strongly linked to pre-post participation shifts in career preferences. The geographical location of the school was less informative than particular school differences, such as number of male teachers and student selection on the basis of interests and academic histories, particularly in math and science.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how English proficiency and self-efficacy, or the belief that one can make a difference, were impacted for students in a rural, Appalachian community. These students were enrolled in high school English classes that used service-learning methodology. Selected students who had been enrolled in a semester-long participating class and had studied eleventh grade research through service learning were invited to participate in this service-learning research project. The service-learning curriculum incorporated problem identification and needs assessment; survey development; analysis of existing and collected data; problem/solution design and implementation; and evaluation and communication of results. Impacts studied included English course grades, the State of Georgia's English Language/Arts Graduation Test scores, the regional RESA averages, the state averages, high school completion rates, dropout rates, and SAT scores for the target county compared with two geographically similar counties and student levels of self-efficacy. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-tests. Eight semesters of junior and senior grades were analyzed for treatment and control groups. All comparisons for seniors were significant at a .05 level of significance. Six of eight semester comparisons for junior grades were significant at a .05 level. The treatment group scored higher than the state average, the regional RESA average, and two demographically similar counties on the state mandated English/language arts graduation test. The SAT scores, graduation rate, and the dropout rates for the treatment group were consistently better than the comparison counties. The treatment group demonstrated strong levels of self-efficacy.

AB  - In this mixed-methods study, we examine the potential of place-based stewardship education (PBSE) for nurturing rural students' community attachment and aspirations to contribute to the preservation of the environmental "commons." Analyzing pre- and post-experience surveys (n = 240) and open-ended responses (n = 275) collected from middle school students in a Northeast Michigan school district, we found significant increases in students' environmental sensitivity, environmentally responsible behaviors, community attachment, and confidence in their capacities for civic action. Analyses of open-ended responses pointed to the potential of PBSE to nurture students' identification with their community and to increase their commitment to stewardship of their community's natural resources. This study makes a unique contribution to the literature on rural schools by focusing on the environmental commons and younger generations' commitments to preserve it as an asset of rural communities. By linking students' learning with collective action to preserve the environmental commons, PBSE can expand students' aspirations for the kind of world they want to live in and the roles they might play in it.

AB  - An evaluation was conducted of the service-learning-based Community Connection program at Baker Middle School in south Texas to determine whether the program is having an impact on student achievement, attendance, perception toward self, school, and community. Data were collected through a survey of a sample of 120 students from the target population of 8th grade students who participated in the Community Connection program during the 1999-2000 school year, along with a teacher survey and interviews with teachers and administrators, a literature review, site observations, and school records. The study found that the Community Connection program has had a significant positive impact on student achievement, student attendance, and student behavior. The surveys also indicate a positive perception among students and teachers participating in the program. The study concluded that implementation of a service-learning program requires professional staff development, school support, and careful planning in order to be successful. (KC)

AB  - The current study compared perceived language gains between learners of different preprogram proficiencies, academic interests, and genders who participated in the same predeparture preparation and short-stay service learning program abroad. L2 learners studying Spanish and computer science students participated in a semester-long program to design two 1-week technology summer camps for middle school students in the Dominican Republic, followed by a sojourn to the site where participants led all camp learning and social activities. Representative statements from the "NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements" (2015) were used to measure students' self-assessed predeparture and postdeparture ability in the three modes of communication (interpersonal speaking, interpretive listening, and presentational speaking). Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in self-assessed language gain across the modes, with females and students with a higher predeparture proficiency reporting greater gains in perceived language development. Implications for instructional design and implementation of short-term study abroad are discussed.

AB  - The role of experiential education is the focus of this paper describing the treatment program at De La Salle Vocational, a day vocational high school for adjudicated delinquent youth. The paper begins by discussing the characteristics and needs of the students and describing the Off-Campus Program, a 3-year research model designed to address the students' need for life skills. Four off-campus, experience-based learning modules are explained: (1) stress/challenge courses adapted from Outward Bound; (2) service learning courses based on the work of the National Commission of Resources for Youth and the National Student Volunteer Program; (3) adventure learning courses combining active experiences with traditional subject areas; and (4) community based learning that combines intensive study of one topic area while interacting in the community. The overall treatment program is illustrated through the example of a fictitious student named Rich whose experiences are used to demonstrate the integration of academic and vocational skills with experiential learning. The final part of the paper reports preliminary findings of the project evaluation, which show significant changes in both drug use and legal involvement following the treatment program. Pre- and post-treatment results are discussed for frequency of drug use, number of arrests, interpersonal maturity, family roles, self-esteem, and school problems. A list of selected references is provided. (JHZ)

AB  - Students participate during service learning courses in a service project, which fits to a community need and has a link to curricular content. Students have a chance while engaged in the service project to apply curricular content in community practice, where they gain insights into civic engagement activities. Empirical studies revealed the effects of service learning, such as its influence on the self-concept, self-efficacy or attitudes to be engaged. However, a lack of research regarding the link between learning design patterns and the effectiveness of service learning can be found. Learning design patterns are teaching or methodical interventions to support the learning and service process of the students. This article presents a study on the experiences of students and charitable organizations in a service learning course concerning the learning design patterns. A mixed-methods design including questionnaires and interviews has been used. Significant effects regarding students' development of their self-efficacy, self-concept and attitude to being engaged were found. The qualitative results provide a deeper understanding of these changes, including the different perspectives from students and from charitable organizations. The results show differences in the learning design patterns perceived and its support for the service and learning process.

AB  - The authors suggest and operationalize effective strategies for the facilitation of effective School/University partnerships by presenting the strategic design and implementation of a 4 million dollar federal GEAR UP grant. The objective of the GEAR UP grant is to increase the number of students from five participating middle schools who ultimately attend and successfully matriculate through the university level. Middle school students were selected from within the grant receiving University's catchment area. Participating schools were selected across variables of number of students receiving free or reduced lunch, number of English as a Second Language (ESL) students, and rank upon the Academic Performance Index (API). Rationale and first year outcome of the utilization of a service learning model for comprehensive program delivery is examined. The authors make recommendations for the optimization of service to Latino and African American students and their families, facilitation of 100 percent buy in from all partnership stakeholders, marriage of curriculum enhancement to the objectives of the partnership, and the embodiment of democratic dispositions conducive to the access of stakeholder expertise.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an academic service learning project on ninth-grade students' science achievement and attitudes. A quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design was used with four classes of one teacher in a rural school. The treatment was an Energy Fair service project. Two treatment classes that were chosen by random assignment (n = 58) were compared to two control classes (n = 64), who performed an alternative assignment. The Energy Fair was conducted for the elementary school students and on a limited basis for fellow students (peers). The academic effect was measured by a teacher-designed end-of-unit ecology test, with a subset of the questions on energy use. Psychological effects were measured by a self-esteem questionnaire, which measured both self-esteem and the satisfaction felt about one's self-esteem. Social effects were measured by three semantic differentials, one each for “adults,” “peers,” and “elementary students.” The teacher was interviewed regarding her observations about the project. Written reflections from both the treatment and control groups were coded and analyzed. Pretest results were divided into thirds of high, medium, and low for all variables to search for the possibility of an attribute-treatment interaction. Analysis of covariance was used to reduce the possibility of pretest bias, to test for significant effects, and to test for a level by treatment interaction. Although the posttest means favored the experimental group, no statistically significant difference was found for academic results. No significant effect was found for either of the psychological measures. No change was found for the social results regarding “adults.” A statistically significant effect was found for social results in the categories of “elementary students” and “peers.” No statistically significant level by treatment interaction was found. Further research on the effects of academic service learning projects is needed at the middle school level, in all disciplines, and containing service of a longer duration and intensity.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection of feminism and service-learning by describing the creation of a women’s studies course for girls attending an alternative high school. In the course participants could critique sexist practices in the media and in the school, as well as establish cultural competence through engaging in service projects that they would lead. The researchers found that course content correlated with students’ identity development regarding sexual harassment awareness and prevention. Furthermore, participants’ increased their internal motivation (locus of control) in general and self-identification with feminism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Low seat belt use and higher crash rates contribute to persistence of motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of teenage death. Service-learning has been identified as an important component of public health interventions to improve health behavior. Methodology: A service-learning intervention was conducted in eleven selected high schools across the United States in the 2011-2012 school year. Direct morning and afternoon observations of seat belt use were used to obtain baseline observations during the fall semester and post-intervention observations in the spring. The Mann-Whitney U test for 2 independent samples was used to evaluate if the intervention was associated with a statistically significant change in seat belt use. We identified factors associated with seat belt use post-intervention using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Overall seat belt use rate increased by 12.8%, from 70.4% at baseline to 83.2% pbst-intervention (p < 0.0001). A statistically significant increase in seat belt use was noted among white, black, and Hispanic teen drivers. However, black and Hispanic drivers were still less likely to use seat belts while driving compared to white drivers. Female drivers and drivers who had passengers in their vehicle had increased odds of seat belt use. Conclusion: A high school service-learning intervention was associated with improved seat belt use regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, but did not eliminate disparities adversely affecting minority youth. Continuous incorporation of service-learning in high school curricula could benefit quality improvement evaluations aimed at disparities elimination and might improve the safety behavior of emerging youth cohorts.

AB  - Last year, 15 students in the Montpelier (Vermont) High School's Advanced Placement Spanish class paid class-time visits every week to a nearby dairy farm. They interacted with the Mexican laborers by conversing with them in Spanish, having picnics together, and playing cards and soccer. As the students advanced their Spanish verbal skills, they also befriended the workers, helping to ease their feelings of loneliness. Identifying a community problem or need and helping to solve it via student-led initiatives is at the heart of service learning. This is exactly what the 15 students did by forging bonds with the migrant workers. The Montpelier project is an example of the teaching strategy that combines service activities with learning objectives. Another example is the Raymond project of the Raymond School District in Franksville, Wisconsin, in which approximately 100 fifth- and sixth-graders in 2010 made no-sew blankets and sent them overseas to Chinese students left homeless by a series of earthquakes. The yearlong initiative involved social studies, math, and science and reading lessons about China and natural disasters in general. The author says where service learning is the norm in school districts, the end result is usually student empowerment.

AB  - Identifying a community problem or need and helping to solve it via student-led initiatives is at the heart of service learning. Projects can tackle social issues with global impact or fill in a smaller local need using creativity and ingenuity. Service learning projects can range from a few weeks to a full semester or longer. Where service learning is the norm in school districts, the end result is usually student empowerment. Young people can provide meaningful contributions to the community. An added bonus is that they can simultaneously master curriculum and develop real-world skills that will prepare them for their future.

AB  - This action research study examines student reactions to a sixty-hour community service graduate requirement at an all-girl, Catholic high school; identifies reasons for the apathy and disdain with which students view the requirement; and suggests creating a service learning environment that will increase students' investment and interest in participating in service projects by making curricular connections to the community service. The perceptions and attitudes of 80 tenth grade students towards the community service requirement were gauged through conversations, a review of journal reflections, and surveys. Results suggested that students felt that the requirement was an imposition that had little to do with their classes or high school career. In order to challenge this position, the researcher introduced service learning into the classroom by scheduling weekly discussions of community hopes and concerns and encouraging students to interact with the community. Service learning is intended to challenge and change status quo rather than reinforce inequalities in place through disconnected service projects, and it allowed students to chose projects, such as neighborhood cleanups, that related to both their curriculum and their community. This resulted in an enthusiasm that appeared to bring more understanding of the need for a service graduation requirement. (Includes 3 appendices, 4 charts, 9 tables, and 30 references.) (MO)

AB  - This report presents evaluation results of the Learn and Serve America, Higher Education (LSAHE) federal initiative. The report addresses the impact of LSAHE on students, communities, and higher education institutions, and is based on data collection and observation from fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997. The broad goals of LSAHE are to: engage students in meeting the unmet needs of communities while enhancing their own academic learning, their sense of social responsibility, and their civic skills through service-learning. Evaluation involved 300 institutions each year that responded to an accomplishments survey, a community impact survey, and a student survey. Site visits and analysis of secondary data were also conducted. The evaluation concluded that LSAHE was a critical catalyst on many campuses for the initiation, growth, and enhancement of service-learning programs and courses. Evaluation results are detailed for five areas: (1) the work that LSAHE programs performed; (2) the impact of LSAHE participation on service providers; (3) the impact of the work performed by LSAHE programs on service recipients; (4) the institutional impact of LSAHE; and (5) the return on the LSAHE investment. Recommendations urge goal clarification, encouragement of more direct service, and specification of "good practices" in service-learning. (DB)

AB  - The purpose for this study was in search of an effective service learning program that would impact student achievement on standardized math testing, especially in the urban school setting where there is a shortage of educational resources and real-world learning. A lack of effective math programs in the urban school setting has been viewed as one of many contributing factors for low income students lagging behind their counterparts in education. This study was a descriptive, non-experimental, comparison quantitative study that involved 6th grade students that were in attendance at a K-8 urban school in Ohio during the 2009-2011 academic school years. The research was designed to investigate if there was a significant difference among students’ math performance on standardized math testing, while engaged in a service learning program. This study was conducted utilizing a quantitative comparison analysis using an ANCOVA and regression to compare groups. This study was in pursuit of an effective program that assisted with bridging the standardized achievement gap in mathematics in an urban school district. The null hypothesis was accepted and the alternative hypothesis was rejected based on the data findings. The data output of this study has shown that there is no significant difference between economically advantaged and economically disadvantaged students when engaged in service learning and participating on the OAA math test. More research needs to be done in this area, preferably using a more sophisticated research approach based on experimental or mixed methods. This study hopes to fill the gaps in the understanding of this area and contribute to the field of education.

AB  - The present study investigated how school climate, school connectedness and academic efficacy beliefs inform emergent civic engagement behaviors among middle school youth of color. These associations were examined both concurrently and longitudinally using a developmentally appropriate measure of civic engagement. Data were drawn from two subsamples of a larger study of social/emotional development in middle school (cross-sectional sample n = 324; longitudinal sample n = 232), M = 12 years old, 46 % female, 53 % male. Forty-two percent (42.2 %) of the sample self-identified as African American, 19.8 % as Multiracial or Mixed, 19.4 % as Latino, 11.6 % as Asian American or Pacific Islander, 11.6 % identified as Other, and 5.2 % as Native American. The study tested and found support for a latent mediation model in which more positive perceptions of school climate were positively related to school connectedness, and this in turn, was positively associated with civic engagement; school climate was also positively associated with academic-self-efficacy beliefs, but such beliefs did not mediate the climate-civic engagement association. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Despite considerable fiscal and structural support for youth service programs, research has not demonstrated consistent outcomes across participants or programs, suggesting the need to identify critical program processes. The present study addresses this need through preliminary examination of the role of program empowerment in promoting positive identity development in inner-city, African American youth participating in a pilot school-based service program. Results suggest that participants who experienced the program as empowering experienced increases in self-efficacy, sense of civic responsibility, and ethnic identity, over and above general engagement and enjoyment of the program. Preliminary exploration of differences based on participant gender suggests that some results may be stronger and more consistent for males than females. These findings provide preliminary support for the importance of theoretically grounded program processes in producing positive outcomes for youth service participants.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not service learning could be considered an alternative teaching method in an environmental science classroom. In particular, the results of this research show whether an energy audit service learning project influenced student environmental awareness (knowledge of environmental issues, problems, and solutions), student personal actions/behaviors towards the environment, student perceptions and attitudes of science related careers, and community partnerships. Haines (2010) defines service learning as “a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities” (p. 16). Moreover, service learning opportunities can encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and learn from hands-on experiences and apply knowledge obtained from lectures and classroom activities to real life situations. To add to the growing body of literature, the results of this study concluded that an energy audit service learning project did not have a measureable effect on student perceptions and attitudes of science related careers as compared to a more traditional teaching approach. However, the data from this study did indicate that an energy audit service learning project increased students personal actions/behaviors towards the environment more than a direct teaching approach.

AB  - This study examined the efforts of three rural middle schools implementing service-learning programs, focusing upon the types and level of satisfaction students gained from their experience. It reviews the literature illustrating the educational theories supporting service-learning, describes policies and practices (including specific programs), summarizes research findings on the impact of service, and suggests some issues for educators to consider. Three teachers and one hundred forty-two 7$\sp{\rm th}$ and 8$\sp{\rm th}$ grade students participated in this research study. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with the teachers and a random group of students from each site, a written student survey and review of documents from the schools. The consequences of the students' experiences were analyzed by a framework that categorized their responses according to core principles deemed essential in implementing service-learning and included: orientation and training, relevance and need to the local community, level and type of reflection offered and manner of feedback provided. Characteristics of their experience (i.e. factors they felt positively contributed to their attitudes about themselves, others and community) as a result of their participation are also reported. The results of this study demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of students found their experience to be challenging and rewarding despite the lack of structured reflection and formative assessment applied across all three schools. The strong, positive perception of service-learning benefits reported by the majority of students in this study suggest that this type of experiential learning should be incorporated as a component in current school reform efforts.

AB  - his study sought to investigate the effects of the Lighthouse Partnership After-School Service-Learning Program on middle school students' attitudes and actions related to social and academic responsibility. This experimental study used quantitative methods and a single-group pretest-posttest design. Because a single sample was being treated with a specific learning program, which was seeking to change certain characteristics of that sample, this design was thought to be appropriate. Results indicated that the Lafayette Middle School students participating in the Light House Partnership After-School Service-Learning Program showed statistically significant increases in Social and Academic Responsibility scores. To further explore possible relationships between Social and Academic Responsibility Score and gender, grade level, and age, additional data analyses were conducted. None of the differences reached statistical significance.

AB  - Each year in the United States, millions of students experience suspension from public schools (Mendez & Knoff, 2003). Community service programs provide one means to address the school suspension problem. These initiatives are characterized by volunteer service placements within community nonprofit organizations for skill and personal development. During 2003-2005, a pilot community service program was implemented in nine school districts throughout the state of North Carolina. This article provides a comprehensive review of that project. Promising results from this initiative emphasize the significance of community service and public school collaborations in assisting youth to stay in school and become productive citizens.

AB  - This evaluation study provides descriptive information about the implementation and outcomes of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (CCLC) program in West Virginia, from September 2013 through May 2014. The report draws on information from online surveys of directors of 27 CCLC programs and from school teachers for 2,117 of the 11,432 participating students. Most participating students were in the elementary grades. The mean number of days students attended ranged from about 9 to 93 days, depending on the program. Teachers perceived the greatest improvements in participating students' behaviors related to completing homework to teachers' satisfaction, participating in class, turning in homework on time, and being attentive in class. Regarding CCLC program volunteers, the largest sources were K-12 and higher education service learning programs. The groups with which program directors reported the greatest level of success were local clubs, AmeriCorps, and local businesses. Regarding work with partners, the most frequent types of support received were program resources, joint planning, and programming. With the exception of a few activities, 80% or more of program directors who had engaged in the various partnership activities considered them to be effective. Regarding professional development, the topics best attended by program directors were programming, staff development, family involvement, integrating afterschool with the regular school day, STEM/STEAM, and federal/state requirements. As for parent and community involvement, two thirds reported being well below target goals or having no success at all. Program directors reported offering more than 400 substance abuse prevention activities, involving more than 5,700 students and nearly 700 adults. Less than a third of directors reported that the continuous improvement process for after school (CIPAS) was very helpful; however, a strong majority (61.5%) of program directors indicated that WVDE monitoring visits were very helpful. The following are appended: (1) Teacher Questionnaire; (2) Program Director Questionnaire; and (3) Program Directors' Comments.

AB  - This evaluation study provides information about the implementation and outcomes of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program in West Virginia, from September 2015 through May 2016, in which 12,388 students participated overall. The report draws on information from online surveys of directors of thirty six 21st CCLC programs and from regular-day school teachers of 2,034 of the 5,163 students who participated in programming for at least 30 days. It also draws on West Virginia General Summative Assessment (WVGSA) scores for 1,864 of the students who participated for at least 30 days, and a matching group of 1,864 nonparticipants used as a control. The students were grouped by grade level and compared in mathematics and English/language arts (ELA) using changes in scale score means for Grades 4-11. The mean performance level changes for the two groups were also compared, aggregated by programmatic level. The study found that most participating students were in the elementary grades. The mean number of days students attended ranged from about 12 to 112 days by program. Teachers reported that about 60% of students improved their behavior in the regular classroom and nearly 70% improved in completing their homework and class participation. The quasi-experimental study using scale score means for Grades 4-11 showed no statistically significant differences between the 21st CCLC participants and nonparticipants, except for fourth graders in ELA, with participants having a slight edge on nonparticipants. The comparison by programmatic level showed a statistically significant higher gain in ELA among nonparticipant elementary students compared with participants and a significantly higher gain in mathematics performance levels among participating high school students compared with nonparticipating high school students. The largest sources of program volunteers were K-12 service learning programs, parents, and higher education service learning programs. The groups with which program directors reported working most successfully were community organizations, higher education service learning programs, and local businesses. Regarding work with partners, the most frequent types of support received were in programming, program resources, and evaluation. All program directors considered their various partnership activities to be at least moderately effective. Program directors reported their greatest need for more professional development to be in programming, for technical assistance in federal/state requirements; and for information resources in programming and collaboration. More than 60% of program directors reported at least moderate success in parent and community involvement, which is a large gain compared with less than 40% the previous year. In responses to open-ended questions, the most frequently mentioned successes were in the area of program improvement, most often-mentioned challenges were in staffing and staff development. Program directors were asked to make recommendations for how to improve the program for the future. Among program directors who commented, the most frequently mentioned recommendations were for more networking opportunities and sharing of best practices, and for additional improvements in the reporting systems.

AB  - The present study tested a model showing how different aspects of high school courses focusing on social justice and prosocial development predicted prosocial intentions of students (N = 362) 2 to 29 years after they had completed the courses. Results indicated that students reporting more transformative class experiences (higher critical self-reflection, more charismatic forms of instruction, and relatable course content and methods) were significantly higher on prosocial intentions than students who did not. Unexpectedly, more well-integrated service learning did not directly predict higher prosocial intentions. Implications for gender and SES were explored. Overall, results suggest that certain parts of such classes can predict prosocial development.

AB  - Contemporary society in general and schools in particular face many challenges as they endeavor to educate the adolescent. Today's teenager and their high schools are beset with many problems. The cumulative effect is seen in lower achievement, increasing discipline problems, personal and emotional struggles and a decline in participation in the community. These conditions impact both the present and the future of American society. This descriptive study endeavors to present one solution to these pressing problems--service-learning. Nine high school service-learning programs are profiled in detail. The purpose of this study is to enable those who might be interested in developing a service-learning program to profit from the experience and wisdom of these pioneers in the field. The profiles of these programs detail the design and implementation strategies which have been found successful in establishing and developing a service-learning program. The descriptions are gleaned from the proposals each program prepared for submission to the California Department of Education in order to obtain funding. Additional information is provided by the interviews with the directors of six programs which have been operational for at least one year. Research has shown and this study supports the conclusion that service-learning programs have a positive effect on the intellectual, social and psychological development of the participants. Students experience a heightened sense of personal and social responsibility, more positive attitudes toward adults and others, enhanced self-esteem, growth in moral and ego development, and the development of skills which will help them live and work more happily, effectively and successfully. Teenagers who are involved in service learning become more aware of the needs of those around them and become more committed to using their time and talent to make a positive difference in their communities.

AB  - Originating as counter normative pedagogies, both service-learning and critical pedagogies hold a common commitment to subvert and transform facets of school life that may alienate and oppress students. This article explores how critical pedagogies and service-learning might provide complementary benefits and become a more compelling emancipatory pedagogy of 'critical service-learning' for K-12 educational contexts. This work proposes that these pedagogies of civic literacy and critical literacy can break their boundaries to intersect and provide a form of education for those students most marginalized and alienated by oppressive features of traditional instruction.

AB  - The influences of high school community service participation, extracurricular involvement, and civic knowledge on voting and volunteering in early adulthood were examined using the National Educational Longitudinal Study. The major finding in this study is that both voluntary and school-required community service in high school were strong predictors of adult voting and volunteering. In addition, involvement in high school extracurricular activities was predictive of voting and volunteering. Civic knowledge was related only to voting. The authors consider the findings for their policy relevance and their contributions to theoretical debates. (Contains 4 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - Need in Deed (NID) is a non-profit organization which has been serving Philadelphia schools since 1987. The organization aims to promote youth engagement in their schools and communities by working with teachers to develop and implement service learning projects in which students can apply academics to real life problems. Until recently, NID staff worked directly with students, visiting classrooms on multiple occasions throughout the school year to lead students in carrying out service learning projects. However, a desire to expand their reach and see service learning sustained beyond their involvement led NID to develop a new program model where NID staff train teachers to lead service learning projects themselves. NID began to develop this approach in 2004. In 2006-07, NID worked with 30 teachers in thirteen schools in the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) reaching approximately 700 students with service learning. NID asked Research for Action (RFA) to conduct an evaluation during the 2006-07 school year. The evaluation aimed to learn more about the effect of the new model on network participants and their students. Results indicate that service learning energized both teachers and students.

AB  - Service learning has been proposed as one strategy to empower youth, engage students, and provide real-life applications for classroom learning. One model of service learning, "The Helper Model," which was designed specifically for use with middle school students, is presented here. Data to test the model were collected from over 500 students in grades 5 to 8 over a two-year period in an attempt to identify areas of student growth during Service Learning. Results indicate that students perceived growth in several areas. Areas of potential student growth identified after extensive analysis were (1) School-Related; (2) Work Preparedness; and (3) Psychosocial. Other findings, ongoing research, and future directions are discussed. In general, the findings support the belief that students who participated in The Helper Model of Service Learning became actively engaged in a meaningful experience which they believed provided opportunities for career development, improved interpersonal and nurturing skills, self growth, learning specific tasks, and understanding the practical component of education.

AB  - Service learning involves adolescent students in meaningful work within their community. This study examined the personal and educational motivations and expectations of 140 fifth through seventh graders from one middle school in New York City who were participating in a service learning program using the National Helper Network program model. This model stresses involvement in meaningful work within the community for at least 1 to 2 hours per week, linked with a weekly period of reflection involving preparation and planning, thoughtful discussion, and problem solving. Students completed the Student Service Learning Survey before and after participating in the program. Findings indicated that students ranked both personal and educational benefits of service learning as important. Girls consistently reported higher expectations for service learning than boys. Girls expected more positive personal growth such as learning to care for others, better understand people, and improve their community than did boys. Boys were more motivated by grades and course credit than were girls. Results suggest that the benefits of service learning may be increased with insight into student motivations and beliefs and with adequate preparation of students. (Contains 21 references.) (KB)

AB  - Using as prompts scenarios of interaction at a preschool and senior center, this study examined student responses concerning the degree of caring exhibited. Data were collected from middle school students before and after participating in a service learning program involving service in a preschool, and from nonservice students. The service learning program used the National Helpers Network program model, which stresses the involvement of young adolescents in meaningful work in their community for at least 1 to 2 hours per week, linked with a weekly period of reflection. Of special concern was the caring methodology and how indicators of caring related to specific service learning experiences. Initial findings indicated that scenarios reflecting general moral dilemmas or hypothetical situations resulted in socially desirable responses and that scenarios reflecting actual or typical problems at service learning sites yielded greater variability in response. Pre- and post-program responses to the final service learning scenarios were rated on a 7-point scale for degree of caring, with empathetic communication rated as most caring and violent behavior rated as least caring. Differences were found only in the preschool scenario. Pre- and post-program differences indicated less aggressive responses and less punishment after participating in the service learning and a greater likelihood to invoke communication strategies for handling site-based problem situations. Nonservice students were more likely to use behavioral than communication strategies in handling problems with children. Results support the use of the assessment and suggest that service learning provides opportunities to engage in caring behaviors. (Contains four tables to support completed research.) (KB)

AB  - A study examined 64 eighth-grade students' perceptions of opportunities available from participating in service learning and contrasted these with perceived learning opportunities available in school. Each student was enrolled in a 10-week required service learning course. Students visited service sites daily and had reflection periods two times per week during which they wrote in journals and discussed concerns. Sites included preschools or day care centers, senior centers, an elementary school, and a school for disabled children. Participants in service learning reported the following: the experience provided different learning opportunities than school; most strongly felt they made a contribution and had the opportunity to express important personal values; and they felt less bored, more grown up, and more important during service learning than during school. However, the finding that school improved their opportunities for the future more than service learning seemed a function of a small subset of students (n=9) who reported they learned "nothing" from participating in service learning. When these students were dropped from all analyses, this difference was no longer statistically significant. Results indicated great variability within sites. This suggested that the specific activities in which students engaged at a particular site needed to be more closely studied. Students who viewed reflection positively also reported more opportunities available from service learning. (Contains 12 references) (YLB)

AB  - A study examined how research concerning an educational innovation such as service learning can be enhanced by the involvement of practitioners. The context was the Service Learning Impact Study, a multifaceted 3-year study of the impact of the Helper Model of service learning on a target population of 1,400 middle school students for whom service learning was required. The study examined the impact of participating in the Helper Model during early adolescence, identified how impact is related to program characteristics and to the types of service students perform, and developed a preliminary framework and exploratory hypotheses concerning the relationship between reflection and the service learning experience. Data were collected from the following: service learning participants and 400 comparison students, teachers, program leaders, and school administrators, using surveys, interviews, and observations. Work with the Impact Study indicated that empirical studies of such educational programs must find ways to work with practitioners because without the involvement of teachers and students, important knowledge that can inform the research and practice may be overlooked, missed, or misinterpreted, and data may be inaccurate. Three key ways were found to work with the practitioners: establishing a teacher working group, maintaining relationships with schools, and collaborating through data collection. Students were involved through approaching them as the experts, establishing a student advisory group, and serving as a service site. (YLB)

AB  - In 1992, Maryland became the first--and only--state to require service activity of all public high school graduates. Proponents of mandates note that since individual volunteer activity is correlated over time, mandates will create lifetime volunteers. Prior studies demonstrate differences in the observed characteristics of volunteers and nonvolunteers which could drive the correlation in service over time. Using restricted-access data from the Monitoring the Future project, I find the mandate increased volunteering among eighth-grade students. However, the mandate likely reduced volunteering among twelfth-grade students. In contrast to creating lifelong volunteers, my results suggest that the mandate changed the timing of volunteering.

AB  - In 1999, the Ontario provincial government introduced into its high school curriculum a requirement that students complete 40 h of volunteer community service before graduation. At the same time, the high school curriculum was shortened from five years to four. Consequently, the 2003 graduating class of Ontario high school students contained two cohorts, the first of the 4-year cohorts that was compelled to complete a mandated community service requirement, and the last of the 5-year cohorts that was not. Using a quasi-experimental design, we surveyed 1768 first-year university students in terms of their perceptions and attitudes about the nature and amount of previous volunteering, attitudes towards community service, current service involvement and other measures of civic and political engagement. Comparisons of the two cohorts indicate that, while there were discernible differences between the two cohorts in terms of their past record of community service, there were no differences in current attitudes and civic engagement that might plausibly be attributed to participation in the mandatory service program. Results are discussed with relation to the current debate concerning the impact of mandatory volunteering policies on intrinsic motivation to volunteer.

AB  - In 1999, the Canadian province of Ontario joined a number of other jurisdictions in requiring its high school students to complete volunteer service before graduating. The primary objective of this program, and others like it around the world, was to address declining civic engagement within society. Using a quasi-experimental design, we explore the impact of mandatory volunteering on its stated aims. Our findings suggest that volunteering in high school has positive impacts on the political dimensions of a student's subsequent civic engagement, measured here as political involvement, political activism, political interest, and political efficacy. However, those impacts are largely conditional on two features of the volunteering experience: sustained commitment to one placement and a positive experience as evaluated by the student. High school community service seems to be unrelated to social dimensions of civic engagement, measured here as involvement in a variety of social, cultural, and religious organizations. En 1999, la provincia canadiense de Ontario se sumó a otros distritos en requerir a sus alumnos de educación media completar un servicio voluntario antes de graduarse. El objetivo principal de este programa y otros similares alrededor del mundo fue para hacer frente a una caída en la participación cívica en la sociedad. Usamos un diseño cuasi-experimental para explorar el impacto del servicio social obligatorio de acuerdo a sus objetivos declarados. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que el trabajo comunitario durante la educación media tiene un impacto positivo en el compromiso cívico posterior del estudiante, medido como la participación política, activismo político, interés político y eficacia política, pero que esos impactos están condicionados por dos características en la experiencia del servicio social: mantener un compromiso sostenido a una labor y el tener una experiencia positiva de acuerdo con el estudiante. El servicio social durante la educación media parece no estar relacionado a dimensiones sociales de compromiso cívico, medido en este estudio como la participación en una variedad de organizaciones sociales, culturales y religiosas.

AB  - For high school community service programs to have a positive impact on subsequent civic engagement, students must volunteer in a sustained manner and must evaluate their volunteering experiences positively. Using a survey with 1,293 respondents and 100 semistructured interviews with past participants of the mandatory community service program implemented by the Ontario provincial government in 1999, the authors identify how and why students generate positive evaluations of community service requirements and whether the diversity of implementation or the mandatory nature might account for negative reactions to volunteering. The authors discuss the significance of these findings for academic debates about community service and for discussions about the ways in which public policy can promote the civic engagement of young people.

AB  - Community development-oriented service learning (CDOSL) is an approach to service learning that integrates service with the school curriculum and the local community development agenda. This study examined the positive impacts that CDOSL has on rural students and communities. Surveys and case study research were conducted with 145 students, teachers, program coordinators, school administrators, and community leaders in 11 rural Midwest communities. Results indicate that CDOSL was a rare but innovative approach to service learning. Student social capital development was significantly greater for CDOSL projects than for non-CDOSL projects; students developed significantly more favorable relations with adult civic leaders and community organizations when their service-learning experiences pertained to high priority community issues. Student human capital development was not significantly greater for CDOSL projects than for non-CDOSL projects in terms of levels of civic knowledge, skills, and values. Positive community impacts of service learning were rated significantly higher for CDOSL projects than for non-CDOSL projects. Positive impacts included improved perceptions of youth and adults toward each other, closer relationships between schools and government, lower project costs, increased community demand for student involvement, and more timely accomplishment of community development goals. Recommendations are offered to schools and communities and to state and national programs. Appendices present data tables; survey questionnaires; community profiles; and an annotated list of 29 related resources, most with Web site addresses. (Contains 73 references.) (TD)

AB  - The purpose of the study is to determine student views of the influence of the Eco Education Urban Stewards program’s impact on their involvement in community environmental initiatives. Eco Education is a non-profit organization in St. Paul that facilitates an urban, environmental, year-long science curriculum delivered in middle schools in Minnesota. The year-long program ends with an urban, environmental service-learning project. Ten high school students from the Inter District Downtown School who had completed Urban Stewards in middle school took a survey and were interviewed and compared with ten high school students who had a more traditional middle school science experience. Semi-structured oral interviews were conducted with each student. Transcriptions of the interviews were analyzed and compared to the survey results. The survey results were tabulated and given numerical values to compare the Eco Education and non-Eco Education students. Common themes and differences were discovered when comparing the survey results and interview transcriptions of the two groups. Urban Stewards students demonstrated more awareness of environmental issues, concerns and community projects but not by a significant amount.

AB  - Student Action Teams (SATs) were established in 20 Victoria, Australia, secondary schools in 1999, with 11 of those schools continuing with their teams in 2000. The Student Action Teams are comprised of groups of students who identify a school or community issue, research it, make plans and proposals about it, and take action on it. Such initiatives, as part of the school curriculum, engage students in purposeful activities that are valued by the students, that have broader community value, and that meet or exceed mandated curriculum goals. An evaluation, based on progress reports and issues papers, an extensive database, and case studies, found that the SAT program resulted in positive outcomes, including a high identification of students with SATs, flexibility of the teams to work on local issues in a responsive way, integration of the SAT concept into the curriculum, and community links to safety and crime prevention initiatives. Personal and educational outcomes for students included increased awareness of community safety issues, enhanced communication and teamwork skills, and school credits. Issues to consider include the following: (1) understanding of community safety and the "at-risk" requirement of the program; (2) training in leadership, team work, community, and safety; (3) program support and accountability; (4) organizational sustainability; and (5) integration of SAT into the curriculum. Appended are: Initial Program Information, Schools Involved list, and Reference list. (Contains 11 references.) (KC)

The magnitude of the gaps is documented and potential causes summarized. One of the causes, and potential solution, is social capital. Research documenting the strong correlations between social capital and academic achievement is examined. Finally, the paper reports on a service-learning project in an urban middle school that sought to increase social capital. Pre/post data indicate that the number of service learning projects in which a student participated was significantly correlated with a decline in the number of hours spent watching television, the biggest contributor to a decades-long decline in social capital.

AB  - The teaching goal for tradition courses could only focus on rooting mathematic foundation, learning professional knowledge, team-work and strengthening practical skill. The research attempted to establish a pattern teaching mode, flipped classroom mode which keeps the same teaching goal like traditional courses and improves core abilities. To establish flipped classroom model requires teachers to spend long time building up video teaching material and clearly communicate with students. The main role in the class is not a teacher lecturing on the stage anymore but letting students learn by open course ware from cloud at home, have some feedback, questions, and separate into groups to discuss and present which would come up related results in classroom; in this education model, the role of teachers is to assist. In the flipped classroom, cloud teaching material, group discussion, assignment, small project, on-line exams and discuss room were used to reach the primary goal, independent learning. Small project is processed with service learning mode includes four stages: preparation/conception, service/ practice, reflection/ self-critic and presentation/celebration. Moreover this research expects to combine service learning and project-based learning (PjBL ) mode. Through applied PjBL during the service learning progress, students could learn creative design and problem solving by designing and processing the experiment activities which also could express some teaching goals, such as, diverse learning during the service, social care and expand international perspective... etc. The research found out flipped classroom mode integrated with service learning pattern could improve different core abilities.

AB  - The article presents information on a classroom technique for cultivating social and emotional learning (SEL) through collaborative artwork. It features examples drawn from a project in which a class of eighth-graders worked together with a group of pre-kindergarten students to construct a large piece of art. SEL is defined as including skills such as social awareness, self-management, and decision making. The benefit to the older students of having the opportunity to practice being role models is emphasized, and the concept of service-learning is discussed in this context.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine how a collaborative service learning project (CSL) influenced student learning experience. Specific research objectives were to (a) examine student learning experience related to a CSL project, (b) examine how service learning, civic responsibility, and enjoyment influence student academic development, and (c) propose a social responsibility initiative framework for a multi-class CSL project. The findings show that project-based service-learning experience results in both cognitive and affective dimensions of learning where affective dimensions of perceived enjoyment, service learning, and civic responsibility positively influenced academic development. This demonstration project may provide guidance for educators in identifying service learning projects that could expand student learning and also enhance the capacity to foster social responsibility initiatives in their apparel and textile curriculum.

AB  - To help with developing children and changing negative behaviors, the federal government initiated The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001) and the Race to the Top Program (2009) to provide guidance, structure, and accountability for schools. These regulations are focusing on reforming current educational practices by encouraging the implementation of pioneering ideas, which center on common characteristics students should demonstrate and possess prior to graduating. These recent edicts of the federal government are triggering a Midwestern high school to assess current practices of school suspensions and discipline methods, as well as researching the efficacy of implementing a specific Service-learning program as a viable alternative to suspensions. The purpose of the research was to examine perceptions of the effect of a service-learning program on student suspensions. The researcher examined the individual perceptions of guardians, teachers, students, school administrators, and program supervisors regarding the use of a service-learning program as an alternate approach to school suspensions. The questionnaire results indicated the majority of respondents believed various forms of community service helped to reduce suspensions, increased attendance, and built character among students. The pre-questionnaire found: 72% of respondents regard service-learning as positive, 20% of respondents were not sure or did not have a response, and 8% of respondents were negative regarding service-learning. The widely held view of respondents taking the questionnaire indicated that suspensions are an easy form of punishment, do not necessarily alter behaviors, and are a leading cause of lower academic achievement in schools. The post-questionnaire responses indicated that a service-learning program provided intervention techniques to help students refrain from fighting and disrespecting teachers, as well as trained them on how to properly code shift at the appropriate time.

AB  - This study sought to determine whether the locus of control (LOC) of expatriate students enrolled in international schools would shift from external to internal after participating in two to five-day experiential education programs containing one or more of the components of adventure, leadership, service, or academics. These EEP programs are referred to as Ed-Ventures throughout this work because they often combine the academic goals of the educational institutions that created them with adventure activities outside of the traditional classroom environment. LOC theory views an internal orientation more positively than an external one. Generally, those possessing an external LOC orientation believe that others are masters of their fate, while those with an internal LOC believe they are masters of their own fate. A host of negative outcomes have been associated with an external LOC, while a host of positive ones have been associated with an internal LOC. The Ed-Venture programs that were examined within this study removed participants from their normal classroom environments for a period of two to five-days, into an outdoor world that was unfamiliar to them. During those programs, students were divided into small groups, encouraged to cooperate and collaborate with their peers and teachers, continued their classroom studies in the natural world, were actively engaged in leadership/followership activities, adventure pursuits, and a variety of service learning projects. The sample for this study included students from eight international schools on three continents (n=269), which exceeded the number required by the power analysis (n=200) by 34 percent. The study used pre/post data collected from the participant who completed the Review of Personal Effectiveness with Locus of Control (ROPELOC) to make its assessments. The study used repeated measures and two-step hierarchical regression procedures to do the data analysis. The results demonstrate that no statistically significant differences existed between the group with students participating in an Ed-Venture program and the group of students who did not participate in an Ed-Venture program, or between and within groups participating in an Ed-Venture program. While no statistically significant relationships were found, it is hypothesized that this lack of relationship has more to do with too many host national and longtime expatriates possessing relatively stable locus of control orientations being present in the sample. Future studies should refine the current research questions, their corresponding hypotheses, and include several important unstated limitations. Once those modifications have been made, it is recommended that the study be conducted again in order to accurately test the ability of Ed-Ventures to shift participant LOC orientation from external to internal.

AB  - There is an urgent need to increase K-12 science knowledge and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) preparedness for college. State and national data suggest a strong correlation between student performance in STEM subjects and student socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity. Queensborough Community College (QCC) is situated in one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the country. We have developed several service-learning outreach programs in which QCC college students serve as mentors and engage K-12 students in STEM topics outside the classroom. We describe Anatomy & Physiology (A&P) servicelearning/ honors projects through different community partners serving at-risk junior and senior high school students. QCC students prepare and carry out effective activities to convey concepts of human A&P to this younger student audience. Assessments support the effectiveness of our projects as evidenced by pre- and post-quiz scores of K-12 students and positive survey reports. In addition, the QCC Honors students consistently express their satisfaction with the program through their reflection journals.

Through interviews, focus groups, meetings, and retreats, we engaged in a cycle of implementing the curriculum, soliciting feedback, and revising materials. The community's feedback led us to simplify the curriculum, make lessons user-friendly for teachers, and incorporate more engaging activities for students. The significance and implications of this approach are discussed.

AB  - It is widely accepted within the field of community service that reflection is an important factor in promoting personal and sociomoral development. The purpose of this research was to determine if a particular form of reflection-decision making with an emphasis on the ethical nature of community service-has special value in achieving service-learning goals. Three dimensions of adolescent identity development served as dependent variables: agency, social relatedness, and moral-political awareness. 476 high school students were assessed on the dependent variables before and after experiencing 1 of 3 conditions: community service with an ethical reasoning component; community service with reflection, but without an ethical reasoning component; and no community service (control). After 1 semester, it was found that students in the 1st condition (ethical decision making curriculum integrated into the community service program) made greater advances on all 3 dimensions of identity formation when compared with students in the other 2 conditions. Specifically, it was found that they became more systematic in their ethical reasoning and more likely to consider situations and issues from an ethical point of view.

AB  - This theme issue focuses on motivating young people to learn by providing leadership opportunities in school. "Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program: Assessing Progress" (Josie Danini Supik) examines the program's success. This program, which trains high-risk middle and high school students as tutors of younger children, has dramatically lowered dropout rates and discipline problems among participants while increasing their achievement and self-esteem. "Youth Leadership: Great Works in Progress" (Aurelio M. Montemayor, Josie Danini Supik) proposes a new leadership training program to create local teams of students who would participate in community service learning projects and in school decision making and reform efforts. "How Do I Value You? Let Me Count the Ways" (Aurelio M. Montemayor) describes traditional and nontraditional ways of valuing students and offers examples of student-centered activities that enhance student self-worth and provide incentives for staying in school. "Valued Youths: Six Years Later" (Conchi Salas) profiles two student success stories from the Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program. This issue also contains two articles unrelated to the theme. "IDRA's Latest Attrition Analyses Show Worsening Dropout Problem" (Roy Johnson) reports that the percentage of students lost from Texas public high school enrollment between their 9th-grade and 12-grade years was 40 percent for the period ending 1994-95, compared to 33 percent for the period 1985-86. This finding contradicts the Texas Education Agency's recent report of steadily declining dropout rates. Tables detail high school completion and dropout rates for the states; attrition rates for Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics in Texas counties; and Texas attrition and enrollment data for racial/ethnic groups. "Silent Partners in Education" (Conchi Salas) discusses the importance of schools recognizing and valuing the educational contributions of parents and families. Nine additional readings on youth leadership are listed. (SV)

AB  - This paper describes a development process which builds upon the strengths of community service learning and community development by providing teenagers a chance to get involved in the community while providing a valuable service leading to local action. The strategy focuses on building partnerships among students, teachers and local leaders to learn about community leadership, conduct a community needs assessment survey, and address a local need through a community development process. Experience from projects in Florida and Kentucky suggests that this strategy can help youth get involved in the community while providing a sounder basis for the community to act on its needs.

AB  - This paper examines the role of student perceptions of the instructor's and community partner's leadership style on student outcomes of service-learning projects. Extant literature has not examined sufficiently the role of the educator's leadership in service-learning projects and has not considered the effects of the two-source leadership from the instructor and the community client on student outcomes. Student perceptions of the transformational leader behaviors were found to be associated with student perceptions of course relevancy, intention to become involved with community affairs and satisfaction with service-learning. The link between the students' perceptions of the instructor's transformational leadership and satisfaction with servicelearning are mediated by the perceived long-term consequences of service-learning. The practical implications of these findings suggest that the dual leadership of the instructor and the community partner is a factor that significantly influences student perceptions of service-learning outcomes.

AB  - As the 21$\rm\sp{st}$ century becomes a reality, the challenge for new approaches for revitalizing curriculum and instructional delivery becomes more vital. We are focused to realize the impact that the current negative climate, coupled with tight and dwindling funding, have had on our public educational system. With these thoughts in mind, this study examines the impact of a curriculum-based service learning program for middle school students. A Choral Reading model for reading and communications classes was implemented for eighth grade students with the purpose of examining its impact in the area of improved speech and oral communication skills. These are areas which appear to be lacking in today's youth. The study also investigated evidence of improved cognitive learning and greater interest in poetry and literature. Whether an intergenerational program produced positive change in attitudes, views, and relationships of young adolescents towards senior citizens was also explored. This research study provided findings that indicated service learning is a viable curricular method which increase and encourage community support of public schools. It also showed that integrated into the curriculum, the Choral Reading Model is a successful instructional intervention for teaching both poetry and public speaking skills in reading and communications classes. Service learning is a context-based curricular intervention and is global in nature. The methodology for evaluating service learning initiatives in the past has been primarily qualitative. In this study, seven different qualitative and quantitative research measures were used and all of the findings showed strongly significant results. Three quantitative measures yielded statistically significant positive change. The t-ratios for the Rating Scales for the Oral Reading of Literature indicated significant improvement in all six categories evaluated (intelligibility, vocal loudness, fluency, tempo, intonation, and interpretive presentation) as well as in overall ability. The statistical analysis of the Written Attitude Scales and The Measure of Knowledge in Aging yielded evidence of strong positive attitude change on the part of the students. Qualitative assessments included student journal writing, student interviews, and elite interviews. The process of open and axial coding of this data indicated strong positive change. The Checklist of Personal Gains served to act as a bridge to connect, amplify, and corroborate the data from the other six assessments by relating the constructs from the qualitative assessments to the scores from the quantitative tests using the items on the Checklist which received the most responses.

AB  - Both service learning and simulations have been shown to positively impact student outcomes, but they are not often used together. This article examines how to effectively combine these active learning styles to reap the benefits of both. After examining a case in which the two were combined and the impact this approach had on student evaluations and learning outcomes, I discuss how such projects can be successfully executed in a variety of other classes.

AB  - This essay presents the findings of a study employing a developmental approach to student acquisition of social responsibility. Professors at seven collegiate institutions of differing types who teach service-learning courses were asked if they would be willing to include their students in a study of social responsibility development through service learning. Four professors at three institutions were included after certain criteria were met; the final sample was of 56 students, 25 who participated in service-learning projects and 31 who did not (the control group). A new measure, the "Scale of Social Responsibility Development (SSRD) was chosen as the instrument for this study. Significant differences were found between pretest and posttest performance on all three scales for those who completed service-learning projects, and only on the "Activation" scale for the non-service-learning students. In addition, a significant difference was found on the added "Involvement" (combining "Realization" and "Activation" items) scale for service-learning students but not for non-service-learning students. The mean increase from pretest to posttest was dramatic for service-learning students on this combined scale, while it was relatively flat for non-service-learning students. Subject responses did not follow the projected phases, and the SSRD did not yield three clearly distinct scales with these participants, so it is not possible to determine if there was a phasic development of social responsibility. However, since those participants who engaged in a service-learning project showed a significant overall increase on the "Realization" and "Activation" scales, tentative support indicates that service learning does appear to increase social responsibility--at least on a short-term basis. (Contains 4 tables of data and 20 references.) (NKA)

AB  - In this article the authors describe the results of a pilot study conducted with 156 primarily Hispanic middle school (grades 6–8) students to investigate the effects of a service learning curriculum that was a part of both advisory and science classes. The study focused on the effect of service on self-esteem and personal responsibility. Quantitative data were collected using both the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the junior Index of Motivation Scale. For both instruments, student growth was observed. However, these gains were not statistically significant. Qualitative data (student reflective journals, a narrative essay, interviews, field notes, and observations) also showed that the curriculum had a positive effect on students' self-esteem and responsibility. The article also reviews the widely cited service learning literature and discusses the status of recent litigation involving the performance of mandatory community service.

AB  - Roots & Shoots and Wildlife Clubs of Uganda are two prominent environmental education programs that have encouraged East African youth to advocate for their communities and ecology. The programs promote positive attitudes and self-determination through service learning. This pedagogical approach motivates youth to solve environmental problems and champion community-centered conservation and sustainable development initiatives. Using survey-based measures, open-ended questions, and participant observation, this study investigated how youth perceived that participation in these environmental education programs impacted their social competencies, self-efficacy, civic engagement, and ecological values. Results suggest that although there are some common program experiences, contextual differences based on the type of program and school environment influence youths' choice of service projects and may be related to program effects on youth. Our findings underscore the need to further examine the interplay between programs' environmental education missions, settings, and outcomes, especially among young people from developing countries who represent the majority of the world's youth population.

AB  - The goals of this study were to understand the relationships among: 1) high school students' initial reasons for performing community-based service-learning, 2) students' feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness during different service-related tasks, and 3) students' future intentions of performing service. This study is framed by themes of autonomy, competence and relatedness which are deemed by theories of self-determination and identity development to be critical for students' psychosocial development. The study also examined whether these relationships differed for students who do service voluntarily compared to those who do service to fulfill a requirement. Data were collected from 51 high school students who participated in a year-long service project which culminated in an 8-day service trip where they provided extensive home repair and construction services for underprivileged families in a mountainous region of the midwestern US. Students engaged in two types of tasks: construction and social interactions with the service recipients and their fellow volunteers. Data were collected using multiple methods including pre- and post-service questionnaires, interviews, participant observation, and the experience sampling method. Hierarchical linear modeling and ordinary least squares and logistic regressions were used to analyze quantitative data. Interviews and participant observation notes were analyzed in light of autonomy, competence and relatedness and were used to create three student profiles. Students reported increases in autonomy, competence and relatedness as the service week progressed. Students felt more autonomous and slightly less competent during social interaction than construction and felt equally related during both tasks. Required and voluntary service participants reported fairly similar experiences of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Required and voluntary service participants also provided similar reasons and intentions for future service. Profile analyses suggested complex interrelations among feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness that were attributable to students' unique personalities, service experiences and roles in the project. Relatedness was the most salient feeling associated with students' in-the-moment service experiences. Relatedness also emerged as the most influential feeling in shaping students' motivation towards future service. Results suggested that a service setting could provide optimal opportunities for students' development of self-determination and identity. Implications for the field of education are discussed.

AB  - A growing number of educational programs seek to promote young people's participation in political and civic affairs. A common strategy for doing so is to provide students with opportunities to make a difference in their communities. Much research demonstrates a strong connection between a person's sense about making a difference efficacy and the level of participation. Ten nationally recognized programs that engaged students in community-based experiences and aimed to develop students' civic and political commitments were studied for over two years. By drawing on observations, interviews, and pre/post surveys that focused on changes in attitudes related to civic participation, the study was able to contextualize students' sense of efficacy as civic actors and its relation to program goals. This paper explores two common assumptions about developing a sense of civic and political efficacy: (1) when students' sense of efficacy grows, their commitment to future civic involvement grows as well; and (2) conversely, when students become frustrated or come to believe that problems are intractable, their commitment appears to decline (data supported these suppositions). Evidence presented indicated that complex questions surround the desirability of structuring curriculum to promote students' sense of their political and civic efficacy. The findings indicate that opportunities for civic and political efficacy can support the development of stronger commitments; but opportunities for students to learn about and experience the barriers and constraints they and other civic actors face are also important. The paper suggests ways programs might navigate dilemmas faced by practitioners who seek to structure experiences so students can gain a sense of efficacy on one hand, and an understanding of serious obstacles to democratic social change on the other.

AB  - We employed a quasi-experimental design using pre/post surveys and comparisons with control groups to examine the impact of the Constitutional Rights Foundation's CityWorks (U.S.A.) curriculum. In particular, we assessed its ability to further democratic aims by supporting the development of three forms of social capital: norms of civic participation, social trust, and knowledge of social networks. Our evaluation indicates that this curriculum and several of its curricular features (use of simulations, role models, service learning, learning about problems in the community, learning how local government works, and personal relevance) have the potential to further the democratic purposes of education.

AB  - This study of 4,057 students from 52 high schools in Chicago examines the impact of civic learning opportunities on students' commitments to civic participation. The study controls for demographic factors, pre-existing civic commitments, and academic test scores. Unlike prior large scale studies that found limited impact from school based civic education, but often did not focus on what and how students were taught, the focus is on a set of specific civic learning opportunities and it is found that they foster notable improvements in students' commitments to civic participation. Discussing civic and political issues with one's parents, extra-curricular activities other than sports, and living in a civically responsive neighborhood also appear to meaningfully support this goal. Other school characteristics appear less influential. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Using data from an original two-wave panel survey of California high school students and a two-wave panel survey of high school students in Chicago, we find that different pedagogical approaches influence different forms of civic and political engagement. Specifically, controlling for prior levels of engagement and demographic factors, we find that open discussion of societal issues promotes engagement with political issues and elections. In contrast, service learning opportunities increase community-based and expressive actions. Both kinds of opportunities promoted commitments to participatory citizenship. These patterns can teach us about the kinds of opportunities (both in school and out) that can shape adolescents’ civic and political development.

AB  - In this paper, we share an example of how community service learning (CSL) has been taken up within the framework of critical pedagogy in order to assist educators thinking about moving toward a more critical CSL. We draw from theoretical perspectives on critical pedagogy, data from a research study, and instructor and student experiences to explore the pedagogical dimensions of our experience with critical CSL. These dimensions include: course/placement integration, critical pedagogy in practice, the intricacies of recruiting and supporting activist placements, and ethical considerations. We conclude that while critical CSL requires careful design and consideration of the risks involved, it can be an effective approach for critical educators. (Contains 11 notes.)

AB  - Middle grades are a time of transition and development. It is during this time, as students move through grades 6, 7, and 8, that the development of life skills, especially for those who have leadership potential become increasingly important. Within these few years engaged learning and the pedagogical tool of service-learning enhances the meaning and impact of traditional course content and offers potential in helping to develop leadership skills in middle grade students. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence of the effectiveness of a community service-learning project as related to the specific development of leadership skills. The sample consisted of fifty-five eighth grade students divided into one test group and two control groups, based upon the Solomon Three Group Design. The pretest and posttest assessments made use of the four sub scales of leadership, self-confidence, cooperation, and citizenship from the Leadership and Personal Development Inventory developed by Carter (1989). Through a one-way ANOVA, no significant difference among the posttest scores of the three groups was shown at the .05 significance level. Thus, the null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant difference in perceived self-assessed leadership potential among middle grade students who participated in a community service-learning project from those who did not participate, was accepted.

AB  - The framework of cultural advantage calls researchers and leaders to reexamine the structures, paradigms, and practices of effective education. We argue that the moral imperative in this challenge is to critically scrutinize and counter the way education systems perpetuate systematic inequities in opportunities and outcomes afforded to certain groups in society, in effect curtailing cultural and linguistic diversity and innovation. Our findings from research conducted in Hawai'i indicate that learners thrive with culture-based education (CBE), especially Indigenous students who experience positive socioemotional and other outcomes when teachers are high CBE users and when learning in high-CBE school environments. Educational progress will come from forward-oriented research and leadership that embraces the cultural advantages of students with diverse experiences of racism, poverty, cultural trauma, and oppression. By cultivating culturally vibrant and affirming learning environments in lieu of "one-size-fits-all" approaches, educators honor assets found in Indigenous knowledge, values, and stories as models of vitality and empowerment for all.

AB  - Hammatt Kavaloski, a teacher at an alternative high school, attempts to increase students' engagement with schoolwork, improve students' perceptions of themselves, and positively impact academic achievement by implementing a service-learning project. Through interviews and observations, Hammatt Kavaloski captures her students' impressions as they prepare and implement lessons to teach sixth graders in a traditional middle school about Malcolm X. This study, an examination of the ways in which the teacher researcher uses reflective practice to develop and improve a curricular unit, provides readers with an example of the ways in which classroom inquiry can lead to sustainable change.

AB  - High school community service programs are growing in popularity to increase prosocial behavior in teens and to fill an increasing competitive demand for volunteers in nonprofit organizations. The efficacy of these high school community service programs is debatable. The study sought to identify a relationship between teen student satisfaction with the high school community service experience and volunteer attitudes and motivations in adulthood. Using the theory of planned behavior, a quantitative, retrospective analysis was conducted with a sample of 60 adult volunteers who had participated in community service activities while in high school, drawn from a population of high school graduates over the age of 25. The sample was primarily middle class women with bachelor’s degrees, aged 41 to 50 years old. A corollary analysis was conducted using the Volunteer Satisfaction Index for high school volunteer satisfaction and Volunteer Functions Inventory for volunteer motivation in adulthood and the Helping Attitudes Scale for volunteer attitudes in adulthood. Findings indicate an insignificant correlation between satisfaction with high school service experiences and adult volunteer motivations, and a significant correlation between satisfaction with high school service experiences and adult volunteer attitudes. Participants who completed service as a requirement to graduate were shown to have more positive correlations between satisfaction and motivation, and satisfaction and attitudes compared to participants who did not have a graduation service requirement. Future research separating the volunteer functions can provide additional information to educators about the most effective ways to design high school service programs to instill long lasting prosocial behavior.

AB  - AbstractThe book title Service-Learning for Youth Leadership is edited by Shek, T. L., Ngai, G. and Chan, S. C. includes several important studies on service learning and youth leadership. The book includes several important studies on service learning and youth leadership. Firstly, service-learning is a dynamic foundation in the elevation of public engagement and leadership for youth in scholars via making them able to apply their skills and knowledge to deserving people in society. Even though service-learning has significant importance in the West, its progression in various Chinese societies is still at the beginning. This book includes momentous studies on the successful application, forthcoming guidelines of service-learning with the inclusion of success stories of movement in China. Moreover, the book has included the impacts of service-learning on the life of students in term of quality of life, social awareness, civic engagement, youth leadership, social responsibility, and empathy. Furthermore, the book highlights how service learning for youth leadership has a significant role in the happiness and well-being of people. In addition, it encourages and accelerates the thoughts of students, managers and the people who want to perfect the life quality of students and service beneficiaries by service-learning.

AB  - This study reaffirms the potential and power of service-learning as a strategy for simultaneously engaging young people in civic and community life, promoting their healthy development, and strengthening their education. It reveals a core of school leaders who believe strongly in the importance and power of service-learning--even in the face of pressure to focus time and resources elsewhere. Despite the consistent evidence of support for student engagement in community service and service-learning, this study highlights two critical challenges: (1) the challenge of expanding service-learning beyond the core group of one-in-three schools that offer students these opportunities to service and learn--a level that has remained unchanged across the past five years; and (2) the second challenge lies in strengthening service-learning's infrastructures, supports, and effective implementation so that it can spread within and beyond these schools to become an integral, sustainable commitment of schools. These findings only begin to reveal the learning that will emerge from this new study. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - Despite the renewed interest in youth volunteering in recent years, there remain major gaps in our knowledge of its consequences. Drawing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we examine the long-term effects of youth volunteering on the civic and personal aspects of volunteers’ lives. Our results suggest that youth volunteering has a positive return on adult volunteering only when it is voluntary, and that net of contextual factors neither voluntary nor involuntary youth service has a significant effect on adult voting. Regarding personal outcomes, our findings indicate that the psychological benefits of youth volunteering accrue only to voluntary participants, whereas both voluntary and involuntary youth service are positively associated with educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood. Taken together, these results lend support to the case for youth volunteer programs, though the civic benefits of these programs appear to be less dramatic than generally suggested.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct a follow-up evaluation of the Warrior Learn and Serve program at Waiakea High School in Hilo, Hawaii. As a result of participation in this program, the 32 student respondents of this study felt that they were able to make better career-related decisions. In addition, students felt that their level of participation in and contribution to their community had risen as a result of their volunteer internship. Finally, students felt that they gained more skills in working with adults. Two recommendations were made as a result of the study. First, the Warriors Learn and Serve program should continue to be supported by school administration so that the program can continue to be offered. Finally, a study should be conducted to see how employers feel about this program.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct a longitudinal examination of the relationship between sustained after-school participation and a district's Early Warning Index associated with school dropout in a large urban school district. The study included 64,351 students participating between 2000-2001 and the 2011-2012 school years. Data were subjected to hierarchical linear modeling to determine individual student academic growth trajectories over time and the relationship to after-school participation. Results indicate that sustained yearly participation and higher days per year participation increase the likelihood that students stay on a positive academic trajectory.

AB  - This study documents the origins of community service learning (CSL) and describes educational literature that relates to how CSL can become a learning experience in the educational process in middle schools. The case study examines how one interdisciplinary team of teachers in an urban middle school integrated CSL as an instructional strategy or culminating activity into curriculum, or used CSL as an extra-curricular experience for students. Four methods of data gathering were used: interviews, observation, a student questionnaire and review of documents. During 1990-1991 school year, the researcher observed the teachers and community partners planning and working with the students to implement the various service experiences. At the end of the school year, the principal, four teachers and three community partners participated in individual and group interviews. The researcher also conducted a group interview with students as a follow-up to the student questionnaire completed by some forty students. The questionnaire was designed with open-ended questions for the students to provide explanations for their answers. The organization of the data provided information to shape the case study and show the history and development of CSL, the delivery and design, and the student reaction to the experiences. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The principal's vision and leadership affected the way the service experiences evolved. (2) Teachers found the service experiences to be useful as a pedagogy throughout the curriculum disciplines. (3) Service experiences enhanced the understanding of CSL as a process and an instructional strategy with teachers allowing for flexibility and the serendipitous to occur. (4) The integration of service experiences affected how teaching takes place and as an instructional strategy to enhance educational reform. (5) Teacher and students found that service experiences affected their relationships in a positive way which enhanced teaching and learning. (6) Service experiences gave students an opportunity to develop a sense of community by experiencing community within their classrooms, school, neighborhood and city-wide community. (7) Service experiences affected how students learned academically, socially and personally. (8) The process for successful implementation of service experiences needs to be better understood by both teachers and community partners. The principal of Chestnut Middle School and the Gold House teachers and students demonstrated how CSL can be designed and delivered in middle school education. By involving all curriculum areas, they built a model and process for implementation which can be adapted throughout a school district to demonstrate how to build learning experiences for students around a common purpose. The analysis and description of their work has implications beyond Chestnut and can help others understand how to build community, create change and integrate service experiences into education.

AB  - Reviews 73 experimental studies published during the period 1980-2002 concerning the effects of sexual or contraceptive behavior, pregnancy, or childbearing. Examined studies include those assessing (1) sex and HIV education programs; (2) 1-on-1 clinician-patient protocols; (3) service learning programs; and (4) the Children's Aid Society Carrera program. Results show that most sex and HIV education programs did not exert significant effects on delaying the initiation of sex, frequency, or number of sexual partners. Four out of 6 health-clinic appointment programs positively affected contraceptive behavior. Service learning programs reduced either sexual activity or adolescent pregnancy. The long-term intensive Carrera programs of the Children's Aid Society exerted positive effects on the sexual behavior of both boys and girls.

AB  - Few studies have determined the effects of service learning on elementary students' moral and social development, particularly empathy. The research problem addressed the lack of research on how social competence is fostered in special and regular education students. In addition to promoting cognitive development, most teachers look for practical lessons to promote good citizenship through moral, social, and civic learning opportunities. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of service learning practices on students' empathy levels among 50 regular education 4th grade students in a rural K-5 elementary school and was based on Dewey's philosophy of experiential education and Piaget's cognitive development theory. The research questions involved understanding whether there were differences in empathy scores between students in a 9-week unit that incorporated service learning and those whose unit did not incorporate service learning. In this quantitative, quasi-experimental, pretest and posttest control group design study, students in both groups were administered pretest and posttest, the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents. Data were analyzed using an independent samples t test to determine differences between the two groups in changes in empathy levels among children from differing backgrounds. The results showed that females scored significantly higher than their male counterparts and females in the treatment group scored significantly higher than the females in the control group. This study demonstrated that service learning does impact empathy in females and contributes to social change as teachers can use innovative service learning experiences to increase student empathy and help diverse students interact socially and form compassionate relationships.

AB  - The authors of this book join a growing number of voices calling for teachers in diverse, inclusive schools to move beyond facilitating social participation in classroom activities and consider ways to intellectually engage All learners. They draw on emerging work linking critical theory with disability issues; work being done in curriculum studies around issues of social justice teaching, authentic instruction, service learning, and critical pedagogy; and the movement in the field of special education away from a deficit-driven model of education to an orientation that values students' strengths and gifts. It examines the perceptions teachers hold about students with disabilities, students who are racially and ethnically diverse, students using English as a second language, students labeled 'at risk', students placed in both 'high' and 'low' academic tracks, and students in urban schools; highlights how students who traditionally have been denied access to challenging work and educational opportunities can be supported to participate in academic instruction; provides ideas for recognizing and challenging inequities, offers a framework for fostering access to academics for students with a range of strengths and needs, and explores pragmatic ways of increasing academic success.

AB  - This article examines the extent to which service-learning courses affect students' attitudes and opinions. Elsewhere, we used a pre/postsurvey field experiment to demonstrate that volunteering with a homeless person tends to erode the stereotypes held by the domiciled--a confirmation of the venerable contact hypothesis. Here we use the same research design to assess whether students in service-learning courses exhibit a similar type of opinion change after spending a day with a homeless person. We find that even with limited contact a significant number of service-learning students came away from their time with homeless individuals holding fewer stereotypes and with a more nuanced perspective on the causes and consequences of homelessness. Nevertheless, working with a homeless person did have a negative effect on some students and contact generally failed to change students' views on public policy.

AB  - Nine rural Vermont schools committed to linking to their local communities are participating in an ongoing study of how manifest curricula (what is taught) and latent curricula (how classes are taught and schools are governed) influence development of student dispositions toward democratic participation. This paper presents preliminary findings from the first year. In some schools that gave students opportunities to practice democratic values and that had a vision of how service learning or a curriculum of place relates to the school mission, school-community relations improved and the student body developed a sense of civic responsibility. The major factors impacting a school's adoption of service learning were school board support, collaborative leadership, common philosophies of education among teachers and staff, and adequate resources and professional development opportunities. Service-learning and related experiential education opportunities engaged alienated and marginalized students. Most service-learning projects lacked strong ties to the traditional curriculum and strong reflection components, and few service-learning efforts emphasized complex social problems, human rights issues, environmental awareness, or social justice. Barriers to fuller implementation and sustainability of existing efforts include inadequate preparation time, transportation, and resources; uncertainty over where to place emphasis and how experiential learning meets academic standards; philosophical conflicts over the role of education; perceived limitations of students; high stakes testing; and the entrenched authoritarian and anti-democratic organizational structure and mindset of current schooling.

AB  - Service-learning helps students experience the practical applications of learning to write well; it also offers opportunities for students to develop a sense of civic responsibility. Although service-learning is growing in popularity, this pedagogy is not prevalent in English departments. Additionally, service-learning courses across all disciplines typically do not empower students to make their own project decisions. Given these tendencies, it is useful to consider whether service-learning is an effective pedagogy for writing, whether students should be designing their own projects, and what writing instructors could do to facilitate students' growth as writers while completing projects in the community. This is a qualitative case study, incorporating quantitative data, of two technical writing courses. I reviewed the students' answers to surveys developed for this research, plus their course evaluations, individual reflective writing, and collaborative project documents, and then I compiled and collated the students' references to what they were learning and what they were struggling with. The references fall within the following themes: student decision-making; the role of the instructor; the rhetorical tenets of audience and purpose; service; collaboration with peers and community members; written expression; and professionalism and motivation. Relying upon the students' comments in regard to these themes, I suggest that service-learning can help students become invested in the outcome of their written expression, motivating them to learn how to address audience and purpose through strong writing. Students learn to work collaboratively and develop their own individual voices as they discover, reflect upon, and express their ideas and shared knowledge. Instructors should ask students to design their own projects, allowing them to engage with and learn how to contribute to the community: through self-directed experiential projects, students become more likely to understand the power of writing and to transfer their new knowledge to later situations. I conclude with a discussion of the need for targeted research and suggestions for teaching writing through community-based pedagogy to enhance civic engagement.

AB  - Recent studies on the status of American education have called for more opportunities for students to do service as a part of their school curriculum. Previous investigators have discussed the difficulty of measuring changes in student behavior as a result of their involvement in service learning programs. Although research findings are mixed, a number of studies found that deliberate interventions helped to raise moral reasoning and self-concept levels. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the possible impact a school-sponsored service program had on a group of high school students enrolled in one of four service programs for 15 weeks during the fall semester of 1990. A pretest composed of semantic differential scales, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Janis-Field Feelings of Inadequacy Scale, was administered to the service learning participants and a control group. The posttest consisted of the same instruments with the addition of a Community Experience Checklist completed by the service group participants. Paired t-test and Repeated Measures ANOVAs were performed to measure any differences in scores. Student journals describing the service participants' experiences were also reviewed. The hypotheses tested: (1) There is no difference in the self-esteem and attitudes toward the school and community between high school students who are involved in a school-sponsored service learning experience and those who are not involved. (2) There is no difference in select changes in self-esteem and attitudes toward the school and community between at-risk and minority high school youth participating in the school-sponsored service learning program and the other participants in the program. (3) There is no difference in select changes in self-esteem and attitudes toward the school and community and the type of school-sponsored service learning program in which the students participated. These hypotheses were rejected. Results from the measures employed in this study demonstrated that certain experimental service learning programs did have an impact. The success of certain service learning programs may be influenced by reflective discussions following the activities and the planning and supervision that went into these programs.

AB  - Given the role past research suggests adolescent identity might play in a student's decision to stay in school, this thesis focuses on the role service-learning plays on student self-concept to help address the high school dropout epidemic. The mixed-method, qualitative and quantitative study seeks to discover in what ways service-learning impacts student self-concept. The philosophical framework for this study stems from Dewey's concept of pragmatism. The particular self-theories that grounded this study are Mead and Cooley's symbolic interactionism and the looking-glass-self, and Tajfel and Turner's social identity theory. The data for this study was collected from 28 students from a central Pennsylvania public high school that employs both traditional and service-learning curriculum. Data was collected through a thirty-minute questionnaire consisting of three parts. The first two parts collected qualitative data by way of six open-ended questions asking the subjects to describe themselves and the social groups of which they are members. The third section used Harter's Self-Perception Profiles for Adolescents (SPPA) to measure adolescents' self-concept across forty-five statements representing the following eight domains: Physical Appearance, Social Acceptance, Close Friendship, Romantic Appeal, Behavioral Conduct, Athletic Competence, Job Competence, and Global Self-Worth. Results suggest a positive correlation between service-learning and student self-concept.

AB  - A study looked at how a science and mathematics intervention program for middle school girls, the "Voices" program, affected African American students and their families. Effects of the program on academic achievement and participation and persistence in school were also studied. The Voices program was implemented in one urban and one rural county in West Virginia. Of the program's original 73 participants, 33 were African American. In the first program year, the girls met once a month during the school year for workshops. In years 2 and 3, the girls attended workshops and worked with mentors who had careers in science, mathematics, and technology. In the final year, the students met regularly with school sponsors and were involved in designing and completing community service learning projects. Program sponsors experienced a great deal of difficulty in finding staff willing to work with the urban girls, many of whom were African American. The staff members who were willing to work with these girls did not necessarily have a real sense of advocacy for them. In the rural site, the engagement with the girls' schools and communities was instantaneous and lasted throughout the project. Access was facilitated by the involvement of two African American women who served as bridges to the project, something that was not found in the urban community. Study results show that programs like "Voices" can make a very positive difference for African American girls and their families in rural areas, but experiences in the urban site challenge program developers to think creatively about designing interventions that can provide sustained engagement for African American girls and their families.

AB  - Prior to graduating from high school, the vast majority of youth in the United States will take part in at least one community service activity. Although it is frequently assumed that community service is inherently beneficial to those that take part, the activities and processes of youth service programs tend to be unsystematic and vary widely. In addition, empirical assessment of youth service programs is inconsistent and often lacks methodological rigor. The present paper addresses these concerns in a preliminary evaluation of both the process experience and the outcomes of a theoretically grounded school-based community service program for urban adolescents. The evaluation focuses on identifying key components of a youth community service program, assessing whether the program was experienced as it was intended, and providing preliminary data on participant outcomes. Findings indicate that the program was experienced as both empowering (i.e., guided by student initiative, preferences, and strengths) and promoting a sense of community (i.e., encouraged cooperation and collective decision making). Results also suggest that taking part in the community service program increased youths' self-reported empathy and intent to be involved in future community action, as compared to a group of matched controls. Implications and recommendations for developing and evaluating service-learning or community service programs in the schools are discussed.

AB  - This study has the goal of engaging students in their education through the use of service- learning by making learning purposeful and relevant, enhancing their academic self-concept, improving their personal growth, and in doing so, having the potential to reduce student dropouts from school. The national dropout rate is high with students dropping out of school for a variety of reasons. Some of the more prevalent reasons are that they find school to be uninteresting, non-engaging, and its' purpose to be insignificant. (Bridgeland, Balfanz, Moore & Friant 2010). An inductive approach based on qualitative research was used to collect and analyze multiple sets of data during and after implementation of a service-learning program in the natural setting of a middle school in the northeast. The three research questions for the study were: (1) How do students, teachers, and administrators at a Blackstone Valley middle school perceive students' participation in service learning impacting their learning and engagement in school? (2) As part of their service-learning experience, how did it impact their social and emotional growth as perceived by students, teachers, and administrators? And (3) How has the service-learning experience impacted students' perceptions of school and their choice to continue? Data was collected through multiple methods including reflective journals, observations, questionnaires, focus groups, and interviews, and was analyzed based on students, teachers, and administrators' perspectives and experiences as recorded through documents, observations, and focus groups. Categorizing and coding was used to sort data and evaluate whether implementing a service learning curriculum was effective in changing students' perceptions and behaviors towards their education.

AB  - The QuikSCience Challenge science education program combines a cooperative team project emphasizing community service with an academic competition for middle and high school students. The program aims to develop leadership abilities, motivate interest in ocean sciences, engage students in community service and environmental stewardship, and encourage students to take ownership of their education. In a formal evaluation of the program in 2006, students' and teachers' responses highlighted key program benefits of social learning, increased knowledge and interest in science, community service, and enhanced interest in ocean science careers. These impacts were also extended well beyond the participants of the program to peers, families and community members at large. QuikSCience also facilitated enhanced civic participation and cross-cultural transfer of science and health information in underserved Latino and Asian communities. The authors offer QuikSCience as a model for actively engaging students of diverse academic, socio-economic, and cultural perspectives in STEM and environmental learning and career paths.

AB  - Civic engagement, defined as involvement in community life, is influenced by reciprocal relationships between individuals and contexts and is a key factor that contributes to positive youth development. The present study evaluates a theoretical model linking perceived democratic school climate with adolescent civic engagement (operationalized as civic responsibility and intentions for future participation), taking into account the mediating role of civic discussions and perceived fairness at school. Participants were 403 adolescents (47.9 % male) ranging in age from 11 to 15 years old (mean age = 13.6). Path analysis results partially validated the proposed theoretical model. Higher levels of democratic school climate were associated with higher levels of adolescent civic responsibility; the association was fully mediated by civic discussions and perceived fairness at school. Adolescents' civic responsibility, then, was positively associated with a stronger intention to participate in the civic domain in the future.

AB  - In this study we examine service-learning (SL) value from multiple stakeholder perspectives. including students. recruiters, and community service project supervisors. We present and test a multiple stakeholder model of perceived SL value using structural equation modeling. Results supported linkages between project design variables and SL value for students. SL value was directly linked with employer promotion of corporate social responsibility. Service-learning participant responsibility and desire to learn was related to perceived SL value for project supervisors. Study implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - This article examines students' perceptions of the learning environment in a service learning research course and increases in student motivation and skill development. According to self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), positive learning environments increase levels of student motivation and learning outcomes. Survey responses revealed that students perceived the learning environment as positive and that their level of motivation, including intrinsic motivation, increased over the semester. Students also self-reported significant gains in knowledge and skills. Service learning appears to be an autonomy-supportive teaching tool that can enhance classroom environment and student engagement.

AB  - Service-learning is a teaching strategy that offers students opportunities to learn both in the classroom and in the wider world. This pedagogical tool provides students with chances to directly interact with local agencies and effect change in the community. Thus, service-learning holds the potential to broaden and significantly enhance the learning climate for students. Based on an established theoretical model of academic motivation, the present study examined the effectiveness of service-learning to enhance the learning climate across a variety of academic disciplines. More than 600 students registered in service-learning courses from more than 30 different disciplines took part in the study. Results showed that when service-learning contributes to an enhancement of the positivity of the learning climate, then positive forms of motivation, civic skills, problem solving, and appreciation of diversity significantly increased over the course of the semester. Results also showed that type of involvement, amount of in-class discussion, and reflections are important factors contributing to the effectiveness of the service-learning environment.

AB  - Service learning, a natural link between community service and standards-based education, encourages students to learn about themselves in the context of the world in which they live. In other words, service learning is a method of teaching that enriches learning by engaging students in meaningful service to their schools and communities, and integrating that service with established curricula or learning objectives (NYLC Service-Learning Glossary, 2005). Educational service activities can be done directly or indirectly and they can have a varying degree of “involvement” ranging from community service, community exploration, community action or advocacy and research. In this study, a service learning project at a rural middle school was evaluated. The project was a result of a response to a community need and was seen as a way to reinforce academic skills for an entire 5th grade class. The purpose of this study was to describe a middle school service learning project and its influence on student learning and empowerment. Gender differences for both of these areas were also considered. Specifically, the study looked at three areas: academic gains, overall perceptions about the project and students’ perceptions about making a difference in their communities. In order to do this effectively, middle level learning, motivation, engagement and student voice, as they pertain to the students’ sense of empowerment in helping a community, were taken into account. This was a mixed methodology case study and a pragmatic approach to this analysis was used, where the quantitative data (from surveys) revealed some of the initial information and then qualitative elements from the surveys, journals and observations were added to offer support for the statistical findings. Almost all groups made gains between the pre-survey and post survey on hunger awareness and fraction concepts, but it is impossible to know if those gains were due to the service learning project or other factors. On-task behaviors, as a measurement of project engagement, were examined and were high for most parts of the project as well. Most students stated that they had a positive service learning experience (91%) and that they felt they could make a difference in their community (91%). To evaluate these findings further, analyses were performed that looked at responses to journal prompts and other open-ended questions.

AB  - There a large body of research that examines the benefits of International Service Learning (ISL) and Domestic Service learning (DSL). However, there is gap in understanding the impact that ISL can have on high school youth and furthermore, the comparison of domestic and international and service learning. This study assessed the role that an ISL program plays in enhancing developmental outcomes (academic, personal, social, civic, and cultural) for student participants. It also explored whether internal resources (community service self- efficacy), external resources (perceived social support), and program variables (perceived level of training and opportunities for reflection) alter the strength of the proposed outcomes. A group of students who went on an ISL trip (experimental group) was compared to a sample of students enrolled in an afterschool program and engaged in local community service (control group). The participants in the study were all high school students involved with BuildOn's afterschool program (a nonprofit agency that aims to empower high school youth through domestic and international community service). Students in the program can choose to engage in an ISL experience called Trek where they receive training and education prior to spending two weeks living in a rural community in a developing country building a school for the members of the community. Surveys were administered to the control and experimental groups at the start of the Trek process and again at the end. It was hypothesized that students who went on Trek would have greater gains in all developmental outcomes measured than those who did not go on Trek. Statistical analyses revealed that the group who did not go on Trek had a greater change in self-efficacy, civic action, intercultural competence, and community service self-efficacy than the Trek group. However, the Trek group started off with significantly higher scores in all outcomes to start. While social behavior did not change significantly more in either the Trek or Non-Trek group, it was found that those who started with higher levels of perceived social support were likely to have a greater change in social behavior than those with medium and low levels of social support. Furthermore, those who perceived the training and level of institutional support as high were more likely to have Beater gains intercultural competence. The hypotheses that the Trek group would show Beater gains in developmental outcomes than the Non-Trek group were not supported. The lack of change was likely a reflection of the lack of random assignment, the minimal room for growth among the Trek group, and the outcomes measured. These findings supported previous research that domestic services learning increases personal and civic outcomes. Furthermore, the current study shows that students who seek out ISL experiences are much higher in all developmental outcomes to start suggesting that alternative constructs should be measured to understand the true impact of ISL.

AB  - This report describes the development and implementation of a place-based curriculum for a small charter high school of 25 students in Wisconsin. The curriculum involved 100 days of field studies in local places such as historical archives, a restored wetland, a river valley, and a senior citizen community center. The students worked with 60 professionals and community members over the year, integrating learning into interdisciplinary courses. The students, who reflected a wide range of skills, abilities, and backgrounds, worked together, as in a one-room schoolhouse. The Iowa Test of Educational Development was taken in September and June. In each section of the test there was significant improvement, and the composite score jumped almost three grade levels over the year. Four reasons are advanced as to why these students scored so well. First, being together every day created a learning community. Students' investment in learning cultivated positive attitudes toward learning. Second, the variety of community settings became readily accessible anchors of memory, helping students to retain learning. Third, the many first-hand experiences were critical to students' learning. Finally, because the projects were relevant to the community, and because students understood that family, friends, and neighbors would view their work, an audience of accountability was created that exerted favorable pressure on student skills and abilities. A table presents pre- and post-test scores in eight subject areas. (TD)

AB  - This article reports the results from a research study regarding how school social workers extend opportunities for students to volunteer, serve others, or contribute to their communities and how social workers engaged students in service activities within their roles. The results are one part of the findings of a large research study on the role of youth development in strengths-based school social work. Results indicate that school social workers refer students to existing service opportunities; facilitate service projects and clubs; and create an array of individualized opportunities for students to help peers, younger students, adults, or the community. Examples are provided. Social workers observed that students who participated in service developed more protective and promotive factors such as self-esteem, friendships, and confidence. Students also gained familiarity with the social worker and felt more comfortable going to him or her for help with crises. The findings suggest that integrating youth development principles into school social work practice is a powerful application of the strengths perspective and an important way to build resiliency. Youth development activities such as service can also be conceptualized as tiered interventions within a response to intervention and positive behavioral interventions and supports system.

AB  - Although American schools are required to meet civic education goals of preparing students to become active and informed citizens, high quality civic opportunities (e.g. service learning and volunteering) are consistently less available to youth of color who are typically enrolled in schools located in high poverty communities. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Word Generation (WG) to improve students' self-reported civic engagement (N = 5,798) in the context of a randomized trial that was conducted in several middle schools located in a West Coast metropolitan area of the United States. WG is a cross-content program that instructs students to learn academic words, which are embedded in brief passages covering a different controversial issue each week. Participants completed survey items on how often they help their friends, community, and school, as well as voting interest. Results provide support for the primary research question- participation in the Word Generation program has a significant impact on students' self-reported civic engagement, but not for voting interest. These results suggest that students' opportunities to debate on social issues are crucial to envisioning oneself as an active participant in civic affairs.

AB  - Few studies provide an overview of citizenship education from the primary to secondary grade levels in American schools. Citizenship education consists of specific teaching practices designed to encourage students to become more involved in their communities. This review critically evaluates three kinds of programmes related to citizenship education: (1) character education programmes, (2) political simulations and, (3) service-learning programmes. Students in the primary grades are mainly exposed to character education programmes, which emphasise the importance of developing ethical values. Political simulations are more common in high school civic courses, where students learn the importance of community-level civic engagement (e.g. volunteering). Service-learning programmes can help students in the secondary grades develop a broader range of civic engagement outcomes that pertain to the school and community-level context. This study reaffirms the importance of increasing students’ exposure to citizenship education, while emphasising that certain instructional practices can be more effective in helping students develop civic engagement.

AB  - Background: Nanotechnology education has become an urgent priority to nurture skilled human resources for the rapidly developing nanotechnology-related industries. The promotion of popular science education focusing on nanotechnology is an ideal approach to bridge the gaps in formal curricula, and to stimulate curiosity about and interest in nanotechnology among schoolchildren. Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Nanotechnology-based Popular Science Education Promotion and Teaching (NPSEPT) program through camp activity that was implemented in elementary schools in I-Lan City, Taiwan. Program description: To create a competitive advantage, a human resources development program was implemented as one of the nanotechnology incubation projects in Taiwan and focused on developing an appropriately-skilled professional workforce as well as promoting popular science education. Sample: The volunteer research participants were 323 sixth grade students in four elementary schools in I-Lan City, Taiwan, who were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the nanotechnology-based popular science promotion camp activity. Design and methods: A research tool called the "NPSEPT test" was designed specifically for this study and was approved by experts who evaluated its content and face validity. The questionnaire was divided into three aspects: "Nanophenomena in the natural world"; "Nanomaterials and their scaling effects"; and "Definition, characteristics, and applications of nanotechnology." The effectiveness of learning among the students was analyzed using descriptive statistics, a paired sample t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc comparison. Results: The results of the three-part "NPSEPT test" revealed that NPSEPT significantly advanced nanotechnology learning performance and outcomes among students in the four participating elementary schools. Of the 15 questions included in the NPSEPT test, positive change for more than 30% of students was achieved for eight questions related to nanotechnology concepts. Conclusions: Significant effectiveness of the NPSEPT program and nanotechnology learning outcomes of the elementary school students were observed. The NPSEPT program should therefore be considered an appropriate program to promote popular science with a focus on nanotechnology in elementary schools.

AB  - Abstract The servant leadership philosophy has been expressed in many ways, and while traditional leadership generally involves accumulation and exercise of power by one leader, servant leadership focuses primarily on the growth and wellbeing of people and the community. Schools are organizations that could be used to help develop servant leaders. In order to build a better society, raising the capacity of young students to serve others and focusing on developing leaders who are servants first must be a priority. The current quantitative study examined the predictive relationship between service learning hours and five self-rated servant leadership questionnaire categories. The purpose of the study was to establish service learning as a positive influence of servant leadership programs at private Christian high schools whose servant leadership programs have the mission to develop servant leadership skills. The current study used a descriptive analysis and a binomial logistic regression analysis to analyze the predictive relationship between the number of service hours high school students have completed in relation to their mean scores on the self-rated servant leadership questionnaire categories of stewardship, wisdom, persuasion, emotional healing, and altruism. A Pearson point biserial correlation coefficient analysis on each self-rated Servant Leadership Questionnaire (SLQ) category was run because of the small sample size. The analyses conducted in this study all indicated there was a predictive relationship between the servant leadership ideology mean scores on the five servant leadership categories on the self-rated servant leadership questionnaire, and private Christian high school students who have less than 100 or greater than 100 service hours completed in high school.

AB  - This chapter affirms that with changes in pedagogy necessitated by the addition of a service-learning (S-L) component to a course, S-L endeavors can add value to students' learning. Especially when designed within the construct of a learning-community (L-C), these endeavors can facilitate, enhance, and foster collaborative faculty's research; heighten the institution's presence and reputation in the community; and expand, improve, and the deepen community's outreach initiatives and relationships. To determine the efficacy of these S-L endeavors and their impact on its constituents—students, faculty, institution, and community partners—L-C classes are analyzed using four metrics: one direct (statistical) and three indirect (solicited and unsolicited) methods. Discussed are the values these experiences offer to each group of stakeholders plays the students' perceived attainment of their learning goals in comparison to the perceived attainment of the learning goals for the non-S-L classes (e.g., the comparison group).

AB  - The purpose of this mixed methods triangulation design study was to explore how "service learning" affects "at-risk" student's overall level of Developmental Assets. Quantitative data were obtained by using a pre and post assessment. Specifically, the Developmental Asset Profile (DAP) was used to determine if "service learning" opportunities increased the overall levels of developmental assets experienced by the at-risk student group. Additionally, qualitative data were gained by interviewing service learning participants to supplement the quantitative data collected in the Developmental Asset Profile. Participants included 37 "at-risk" youth who were selected to participate in a service learning program. The students selected to participate were considered to be "at-risk," because they simultaneously experienced poor behavior, poor attendance, and poor academic performance. The data indicated that developmental asset levels significantly improved after at-risk students participated in service learning projects. Results indicated a statistically significant difference not only in the overall level of developmental assets but also in each of the eight asset categories as determined by the pre and post test data. The qualitative data obtained from one-on-one interviews substantiated the quantitative results. Three prominent themes regarding service learning and at-risk students emerged from the qualitative data including a sense of altruism, enjoyment, and associative learning.

AB  - Problem. Increasing scientific evidence reveals that this planet is in serious environmental jeopardy. Since 1977, when an international group of K–12 educators met in the USSR and established goals for teaching environmental education worldwide, many schools have endeavored to fulfill these goals through the use of various curricula and teaching strategies. Although some progress has been made, most K–12 public schools have not done enough to meet the demands of environmental problems. In 1996, my co-teacher and I designed and implemented an environmental project, called Mission Environment, that we hoped would help our students develop long-term positive environmental attitudes and behaviors. Purpose. This study is an attempt to discover how effective the Mission Environment project (ME) was in contributing to long-term, positive environmental attitudes and behaviors among the participating students. Methodology. The study used quantitative and qualitative methods. Data were collected by surveying the members of a high-school senior class to determine their current environmental attitudes, behavior, affect, and knowledge. Of the 71 students surveyed, 28 indicated that they had been ME participants during their eighth-grade year (1996–97). The survey data were analyzed using the students' independent samples t test and chi square. Additionally, through student interviews, the study investigated the hypothesis that the teaching methods used during the course of the project contributed to producing these long-term effects. As a result of reflective interviews about the ME project and data from the literature review, a model has been created for a middle-school environmental education project in the form of an Innovation Configuration. This model is presented as part of the results of this study. Findings and conclusions. The results of the statistical analysis of the environmental survey data showed statistically significant differences between the ME participants and the non-participants. The ME participants reported more positive environmental attitudes, behavior, and affect than the non-participants. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of students in environmental knowledge. From these findings, it could be conjectured that the possession of knowledge about the environment is not necessarily an indicator of positive conservation behavior. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of several researchers who suggest that environmentally relevant behaviors do not naturally evolve from knowledge, but appear to be the result of knowledge combined with the application of action strategy skills. Additionally, the student interviews seemed to suggest that the students acquired other positive benefits from the project. The study highlighted the importance of environmental education projects like ME, which integrate experiential, service-learning opportunities.

AB  - Despite recent figures indicating that 26% of public high schools in the United States require student involvement in community service or service learning, there is little empirical evidence to support such policies. In the present study, successive cohorts of high school students, one without (n = 174) and two with a community service requirement (n = 312), were compared longitudinally on measures of civic attitudes and behaviors. Each cohort was divided according to individual students’ inclinations to serve voluntarily. Students already inclined to serve scored high on all measures throughout and showed no advantage after meeting the requirement. However, students who were less inclined to serve showed marked gains on three of four civic measures after completing their requirement. Whereas they scored as low as their less-inclined counterparts who had no requirement during grade 11, they differed from their counterparts after serving the mandated 40 hours during grade 12. This quasi-natural experiment provides support for the argument that a well-designed service program can have a clear benefit in civic development for nonself-selected youth.

AB  - Recent research findings have led to the conception that values pedagogy connotes a philosophy of learning and principle of curriculum organization with potential to enhance all dimensions of the learning environment. Enhancement includes student responsibility to themselves and others and positive impact on learning outcomes. Allied research demonstrates that a particularly potent feature of such pedagogy is to be found in service learning. The article appraises the research relevant to such claims, including among empirical findings from the Australian Values Education Program.

AB  - Service learning educational experiences and their influence on selected student attitudes and achievement (as identified in the title) were studied through the use of academic records for various sample subjects, aggregate historical data of two other sample populations, and the results of two survey instruments which were administered separately to students in grade eight (8) and students in grades 9–12. These instruments were the pre-experience and post-experience administration of the School Attitude Measure (SAM) and an original Overall Post-Experience Evaluation. The collected data from these sample populations of Avon Lake City School Students were analyzed or discarded due to significance issues through the use of multiple regression formulas, t-tests, correlation coefficients, grade point averages (GPA) and ranges. One primary conclusion has been drawn from this analysis of these various statistical measurements of this data. This conclusion is there is a significant statistical, but small educational relationship between some of these identified factors in this research study.

AB  - This article describes research conducted to evaluate the impact of service learning on exam scores and emotional empathy in a life-span development course. Service learning was 1 of 3 project options offered in the course; others included an interview project and a research paper. With the exception of the first exam, scores were significantly higher for the service-learning students compared to those who completed other projects. In addition, only the service-learning group demonstrated a significant increase in emotional empathy as measured by the Emotional Empathetic Tendency Scale (EETS; Mehrabian & Epstein, 1972). I discuss the results in terms of the relations among practical experience, reflection, and emotional empathy.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to analyse the effect of high school scholarships tied to community service on the development of secondary school students in Northwest China. Using data from three rounds of surveys of thousands of students in 298 classes in 75 high schools in Shaanxi province, the paper documents the implementation of the Compassionate Heart Scholars Program and evaluates the effect of the programme on the educational performance, self-esteem, self-efficacy and social responsibility of the participants. We present evidence that part of the protocol of the programme (which includes the nomination and election of programme participants) improves the academic performance and self-esteem of those involved in the programme. The community service part of the programme is shown to raise the self-efficacy and the sense of social responsibility of the programme participants. One striking result is that the test scores of the community service participants do not appear to be adversely affected, even though they spend considerable time doing community service. The findings of this study, therefore, suggest that adding extra-curricular community service to school curricula may be a win-win-win strategy, for the students, for schools and for the local communities served.

AB  - This booklet, which is intended for individuals involved in the delivery of service learning, provides ideas and strategies for developing or expanding service learning partnerships. The booklet begins with an overview of service learning that outlines service learning's benefits to schools, the community, and service learning partners. Discussed next are types of service learning activities (direct service activities, indirect service activities, and advocacy) and service learning project models (one-shot projects, ongoing projects, and student placement models). Next are explained the benefits, characteristics, and operation of the service learning partnerships with human service agencies and civic organizations, business and industry, and schools. The following four phases of establishing service learning partnerships are detailed: generating a service learning resource file; identifying the appropriate agency options; assessing effectiveness of the project and the partner; and strengthening and sustaining partnerships. The roles and responsibilities of the following partnership members are outlined: service learning coordinator, service learning teachers, students, agency/organization representatives, school administrators, and service learning advisory teams. Concluding the booklet are reflections from students, community agencies, and schools involved in service learning. Appended are the following forms: service learning agreement, community service evaluation, student evaluation, and service learning observation. (MN)

AB  - Based on the alternatives approach to drug abuse prevention, two service opportunity courses were offered to 8th and 9th grade students. Students in Cross-Age Tutoring were taught tutoring and communication skills and spent one period, 4 days per week tutoring elementary students. Students in School Store (a service opportunity developed for this study) were taught business and interpersonal skills and operated an on-campus store. Students who volunteered for either course were matched and one student from each pair was randomly assigned to receive the course while the other served as a control. All students were pre- and post-tested via a self reporting Student Questionnaire, observations and interviews, and most students participated in follow-up testing 1 year later. Affective and drug-specific measures were collected, with positive effects of the courses hypothesized for self-esteem, attitudes toward school, attendance, locus of control, and discipline problems. Results indicated negligible effects for either course, although students rated the courses favorably. Discussion of results is in terms of shortcomings of the courses themselves and limitations of the school-based model of alternatives to drug abuse and calls into question the efficacy of incorporating service opportunity prevention strategies within the school curriculum.

AB  - Civic engagement in adolescence contributes to the positive development of young people and to the health of communities and societies. The present study examined how an open classroom climate and adolescent students' citizenship self-efficacy can promote their expectations to participate in civic activities. Multilevel Structural Equation Modelling techniques were used to examine data from a nationally representative sample of 3,352 Italian eighth-graders, controlling for students' socio-economic status. The results revealed that students' willingness to participate in civic activities, both at the individual level and at the classroom level, was positively influenced by an open classroom climate and that this influence was mediated by students' citizenship self-efficacy. Our findings suggest that an open classroom climate can help students to become civically and politically involved by fostering their citizenship self-efficacy. The results of the present study extend our understanding of civic engagement in adolescence and inform policies that aim to promote it.

AB  - This program evaluation was initiated as a result of parents of ninth grade students in one school questioning teachers about the benefits their children would obtain from taking English and social studies classes as part of the service learning program. The students involved in the service learning program participated in community service activities one day each week during one of their blocked English and social studies class periods. They did not have as much in-school time as students involved in the regular English and social studies classes. Parents, teachers, and administrators wanted to be assured that the service learning program was effective and beneficial enough to students to justify the class time missed each week. Information concerning the essential components of effective service learning programs was gathered. Daniel Stufflebeam's evaluation process, which includes the context, input, process, and product of a program, was used to evaluate the service learning program. From this information, the components of the service learning program at the school were compared to the documented components that are necessary for a successful program. The review of the literature revealed three areas of effective learning programs. These areas are program model, benefit to students, and benefit to community. Each area contains several components. The results of the program evaluation showed that the service learning program at the school does contain the essential areas that make a program effective for all participants. The study revealed a component of one of the essential areas that appeared to be inadequate. Little evidence was found of students performing service learning activities within their own school building. Various programs have been initiated, but none has lasted within the school. Recommendations were made to the school to address this concern.

AB  - To what extent does school-sponsored community service promote social responsibility among high school students? Social responsibility is operationalized as citizen efficacy and social conscience, political and moral aspects of citizenship. Theoretically and analytically, school organization and school community service policy (required or voluntary) are central. Service requirements differ qualitatively in having high-structure (emphasizing service-learning), moderate-structure, or low-structure (simply stipulating performance). School organization may be integrative (communitarian and cooperative, with a strong press for community service) or aggregative (individualistic and competitive). Although the study situates community service in the overall context of American education, the focus is independent schools, members of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), where, compared to public and other private schools, community service is most common. Data collected during 1988-1989 as part of the National Study of Gender Grouping in Independent Secondary Schools provide the quantitative and qualitative bases. Students, teachers, heads, and community service coordinators in 60 independent schools completed questionnaires. Community service coordinators at a subset of 21 visited schools participated in interviews. Multivariate causal analyses investigate(1) social stratification in service participation; (2) school organizational differences and participation; (3) differences in social responsibility for participants and non-participants; (4) required vs voluntary service policy and social responsibility; (5) integrative school organization and social responsibility; and (6) the comparative effects of required vs voluntary service and integrative organization. Because the analyses employ nested data (students within schools), the principal analytic technique is multilevel--hierarchical linear modeling. Patterns of participation in community service differed among students and schools. Gender (female), ability, religiosity, and political orientation positively influenced participation, as did institutional characteristics of schools and the school press for community service. Community service participation positively affected citizen efficacy. The low-structure requirement proved inimical to both citizen efficacy and social conscience. The high-structure requirement exerted a positive influence on social conscience. Integrative school organization positively affected both citizen efficacy and social conscience. The conclusion places the findings in the context of educational policy.

AB  - This study compared the amount of the second language (L2) use and linguistic gains made by students in three short-term language immersion programs: (1) traditional study abroad, (2) service-oriented study abroad, and (3) foreign language (FL) housing. These were chosen because they represent three distinct program types, providing students with different ways of interacting in the target language and different types and amounts of contact with native speakers. This allowed us to evaluate relationships between study setting, language use, and language gains. Learners completed language logs detailing their use of the L2 as well as pre- and post-immersion oral tests to assess gains in fluency, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Although the traditional study abroad group used the L2 the most, findings demonstrate much of this use was due to coursework. When comparing use outside of the classroom, the service learning group used the target language significantly more than students in the FL house and traditional study abroad. Also two of the groups, those in the FL house and service-oriented study abroad demonstrated significant linguistic gains. Results also suggest a positive relationship between time speaking the L2 with non-native speakers and linguistic gains. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - In this article, 1 test claims about students' development and sociological learning by comparing two classes of students enrolled in a Race and Ethnic Relations course--one section that took the course as a service-learning course and another that took it as a lecture-discussion course with some required experiential exercises. Change in students" development over the course of the semester is examined in the areas of citizenship, empowerment, diversity awareness, leadership, moral development, and rejection of individualistic explanations of social problems. Based on results from changes in survey responses, service-learning pedagogy appears to have an advantage over experiential learning with respect to students" development in these six areas. Students enrolled in the service-learning section of Race and Ethnic Relations engaged in service-learning projects by either: (1) working as an intern at an appropriate site; (2) working on a group project--either working with a Latino agency to survey the community's health care needs, or compiling a curriculum for an educational initiative in a housing project, or testing local financial institutions to determine whether they were discriminating against Hispanics with respect to their fees for money-wiring services; or (3) working on a large, ongoing violence-prevention project.

AB  - The efficacy of Educate to Eradicate, a K-12 service-learning science curricula developed as part of a statewide, community-based Extension effort for termite prevention, was evaluated. The curricula use termite biology and control as the basis for science education and have been implemented in over 350 Hawaii public school classrooms with more than 12,530 students from 2001 to present. Student surveys and work samples were used to measure changes in student knowledge, behavior, and engagement. Use of school curricula in Extension programs reaches a large public audience and encourages long-term continuation of community pest prevention efforts.

AB  - While participating in community action and learning, adolescent girls explore opportunities to become informed people commited to positive engagement in the world. This study examines the experiences of students in a private, girls' high school as they participate in community service activities and analyzes their perception of what they are learning. In particular, their learning experiences were explored according to four construct variables: the development of social, practical and academic skills; the development of self-esteem; the development of an awareness of the needs of the community; and the development of a commitment to service. The study was designed around qualitative phenomenological methods. The study is a case study of the experiences of students at one institution and multiple imbedded case studies of the students' experiences by grade levels (9th to 12th grade) and according to the experiences of selected individuals. Quantitative and qualitative research strategies were employed: All students (N = 690) participated in a survey of attitudes at the beginning and end of the academic year for two years. Focus groups (n =103) were conducted by grade level to discuss student experiences. Additionally, two students from each class (n = 8) were profiled. Although the quantitative findings point to only small increases in student growth, the qualitative responses of the students suggest that service learning activities impact their learning, their sense of identity and their recognition of social responsibility. In particular, community service activities afford students the opportunity to recognize their skills, to explore their values, and to interact with others in their communities. The study also considers the implications of the student service and learning experiences in terms of a personal development of identity and social responsibility, and pedagogical utility in these areas of development. Finally, it explores the implications for schools and their programs in view of students' responses to service experiences. As a result of participation in community service activities, many students participate in a learning process based in human interaction and develop an understanding of transformational community leadership. In particular, young women develop a voice of community authority.

AB  - This empirical study examined conditions associated with required school-based community service program benefits from a developmental perspective. It had three main goals: (1) To assess whether the type of program in which the service was embedded and the type of service performed by the student influenced student developmental benefits, (2) To assess whether required community service experience affords students developmental opportunities different from traditional extracurricular activities, and (3) To assess whether mandatory school-based community service programs deter rather than encourage future civic engagement among participants. Questionnaires were administered to 2,300 students in two Catholic high schools, with contrasting approaches to community service. Participants completed questionnaires in the fall and spring of each academic year over a three-year period. Students were asked to rate the developmental opportunities of their required service experience and their most interesting extracurricular activity. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) indicated that students who performed social service reported higher developmental opportunity scores than students who performed non-social service (p <.001). Analyses of gender differences indicated that females in both programs were equally likely to participate in social versus non-social service, as well as males in the service learning program. Males who participated in the community service program were more likely to do non-social service versus social service (78% and 22%, respectively). A repeated measures ANOVA revealed that overall, student ratings of required service developmental opportunities were higher than their extracurricular activity developmental opportunity ratings (p = .01). However, this turned out to be true only for students who performed social service (p = .002). Longitudinal analyses indicated that higher developmental opportunity ratings of required service experience predicted volunteer service one year later (p = .002). This finding suggests that mandatory community service does not necessarily engender resentment and discourage future civic activity as critics have suggested. It is concluded that social service provides students with greater developmental benefits than non-social service and that social service is more likely to foster an on-going commitment to volunteering. A comparison of the present findings to those previously reported provides considerable support for the claim that community service programs provided in the context of a service learning program that is based upon an ideology that clearly explicates why community service is important are more likely to benefit students than programs that are not well integrated into the academic curriculum and lack a clearly stated justification for the role of community service in a civil society.

AB  - Behaviors that warrant school discipline (e.g., fighting, victimizing peers) is detrimental to school climate and the learning process. This study examines the effectiveness of preventing school disciplinary incidents in middle school through an experiential, social and emotional learning (SEL) program. A community youth development organization, two public middle schools in low-income communities and a local university collaborated to design and deliver the program to all seventh-grade students in social studies curricula. This article describes the design of the intervention and its effect on students' suspensions, skipping class, and failing grades. The results of this study indicate that a school-based SEL service-learning program may reduce disciplinary incidents for middle school students. Other attitudes and skills, however, did not change significantly in the anticipated direction. This research demonstrates the effect of SEL curricula and service-learning programs embedded in school coursework. Implications for practice and research include understanding mechanisms of change in SEL processes.

AB  - According to a recent report from the National Center for Educational Statistics, approximately 20% of the United States' high-school aged population is at risk of dropping out of high school, an outcome that strongly limits participation in economic and educational opportunities. The importance of earning a high school diploma has increased many local districts' efforts to close graduation gaps across the student population. Accordingly, this study evaluated a recuperative environmental leadership and service (EL&S) program in a northwestern local district to ascertain its effectiveness in providing at-risk students the personal and academic support required for high school graduation. Following the logic model program theory, this study examined the program's effectiveness in redirecting off-track students by comparing on time (4 year) and extended-time (> 4 years) graduation rates of at-risk students who did participate (n = 96) and did not participate (n = 76) in the EL&S. Through an ANCOVA, the 4 year and extended graduation rates, 68.3% and 89.1%, respectively, were analyzed and found to be higher than the on-time and extended-time graduation rates for the local district, 65.8% and 68.5%. Results indicated that the EL&S does statistically increase the participants' likelihood of graduating from high school. These findings illustrate the utility of EL&S interventions for at-risk students who have experienced multiple indicators of educational failure. Replication or adaptation of this EL&S program could provide social change benefits to educational stakeholders seeking to close the graduation gap; to families seeking educative and personal support for at-risk students; and to struggling students desiring to contribute to the economic, educative, and social growth of their community.

AB  - The landmark Civic Mission of Schools report of 2003 laid out an argument for the role of schools in promoting youth civic engagement and presented a range of promising ideas and practices to accomplish that. In this study we describe the civic engagement outcomes that Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) in Louisville, KY, has chosen to promote in its students. The outcomes constitute a vision of civic engagement that sees youth as well-rounded citizens capable of engaging in civil, political, and problem-solving activities, both individually and socially. In 2007, JCPS revised its annual survey of students to include the above-mentioned civic outcomes and other new measures as part of a whole-child approach to monitoring educational development. Data collected from high school students by this survey in 2008 and 2009 were used to identify and characterize a number of factors which, theory and empirical research suggest, may be important predictors of youth civic engagement. The results show that most of the factors in our models of civic engagement were positively related to youth civic engagement. Using these findings and theoretical considerations, we sorted factors into three levels of importance. Overall, the most important predictors of youth civic engagement in our models were "community service", "political discussion", and "environmental conservation". At an intermediate level of importance were "nonsport extracurricular activities", "conflict resolution skill", and "positive character", as well as "personal efficacy", "willingness to contact public officials about issues of concern", and "intention to vote". Seven other factors were also found to have positive, but somewhat weaker or less-widespread associations with youth civic engagement. Using a large sample in an urban school district, this study reinforces claims that community service, discussion of politics, and nonsport extracurricular activities boost civic engagement. These are three of the "promising practices" recommended for schools in the Civic Mission of Schools report, and this study reinforces the importance of providing them. The findings also provide intriguing evidence of the potential value of environmental conservation, conflict resolution skill, and character education as pathways to civic engagement.

AB  - Do service learning courses offer the opportunity for first-generation students to experience academic and social integration and ultimately, academic success? Our study answered this question by exploring the quality of interaction between first-generation students and faculty that characterizes service learning pedagogy, and by revealing ways in which service learning courses academically engage first-generation students in community service projects. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, results confirm the vital role of communication between faculty and first-generation students and the potential for service learning courses to facilitate the process of integration. Implications for continued research in this area of instructional communication are also explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The traditional teaching of reading, writing, and arithmetic alone will not fully prepare students to lead with integrity, govern fairly, analyze problems, and work collectively with people different from themselves. Social emotional learning (SEL) has been described as one of the missing links in academic education, but a restrictive approach to SEL instruction focuses primarily on emotional and behavioral containment rather than development of active citizenry. Out-of-school programs that provide opportunities for youths to conduct community service learning projects, however, can be a valued resource for supporting critical social emotional learning and social political development. The Chicago Freedom School (CFS) is one such program. This article features the voices of youths' ages 14-16 who participated in CFS during the 2008-2009 Freedom Fellowship, using content analysis. It also discusses future implications for school mental health professionals and SEL instruction.

AB  - Introduction: Most approaches to reducing the socially inappropriate behavior of adolescents target the individual rather than a group. Evidence suggests greater efficiency and long-lasting effects may be achieved when groups of peers work together to make meaningful contributions to their communities through service learning projects. In the systems-intervention program presented here, titled Positive Peer Group, interventions are implemented with the goal of developing enhanced skills, increasing personal responsibility, increasing students' bonding to their school community, developing an ability to manage conflict responsibly, identifying with positive peers, and increasing social skill repertoires. Method: The subjects were 198 students attending 17 schools with matched controls in Ohio, USA. Prior to entry into the program students exhibited characteristics signaling a capacity for leadership whether as positive role models or as potential leaders of a disaffected group likely to engage in negative behavior patterns. Students experiencing the experimental condition were offered opportunities to work together in small, heterogeneous groups on projects that contributed to improving their school or solving a problem that they themselves recognized within their school or community. Results: Self-report measures taken pre- and post-intervention confirm statistically significant improvements in behavioral accountability, bonding to school, anger management, and the establishment of a psychological sense of school membership—all primary goals for this intervention. Discussion and Conclusion: These data strongly support the contention that increased affiliation with the life of the school established through service-learning enhances social skill development and may inoculate children from becoming further disaffected.

AB  - Title IX and Johnson O'Malley services were provided to 1,495 Native American students at 10 Albuquerque (New Mexico) elementary, middle, and high schools and the Homework Center during the 1997-98 school year. The five goals of the Title IX program were to provide: (1) intervention assistance for students, in which students, parents, and staff set goals in areas such as attendance and behavior problems; (2) tutoring assistance, which focused on language arts and math at the elementary level and added science and social studies at the secondary level; (3) student participation in cultural, social, or academic activities to promote good citizenship, community service, and personal responsibility; (4) parent participation in cultural, social, or academic activities, promoted through announcements in newsletters, letters sent home with students, and announcements at parent meetings; and (5) professional development in sensitive cultural issues that impact Native American student performance. In intervention and tutoring assistance, each school level surpassed its goal. The homework center was most effective, followed by assistance at the middle and elementary school levels. Students reported 99.5 percent of the time that the social, cultural, and academic activities were beneficial. Because of low survey response rates, parent participation was difficult to evaluate, but 88 percent of the 18 respondents thought the activities were beneficial to students. Ninety-eight percent of respondents thought that the professional development was somewhat beneficial. (TD)

AB  - A nine-week empirical study of 25 adults in a second language (L2) Spanish phonetics course explored whether students' participation in service-learning language exchange sessions with native Spanish speakers outside of class influenced learners' (1) motivation for foreign language learning and (2) phonemic perception in Spanish. Divided into service-learning and non-service-learning groups, participants overall showed a significant pre- to post-study improvement in phonemic perception as well as a substantial decrease or increase on four L2 motivational factors. However, no significant differences surfaced between the experimental and the control groups.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to identify the service-learning elements that are met through student participation in service-learning projects in elementary schools. The study identifies the types, numbers, and duration of service-learning projects that students participate in at the elementary school level. The study examines whether there is a significant difference between beginning teachers of service-learning and experienced teachers of service-learning in the student achievement of service-learning elements. Finally, the study also examines whether there is a significant difference between beginning and experienced teachers in the student achievement of service-learning elements. Methodology. Descriptive research was used to answer questions one through seven in this study. Ex post facto research was utilized to answer questions eight and nine of this study. The written survey was developed specifically for this research study using research on service-learning, student citizenship, and civic responsibility. The service-learning teachers were selected because they had developed and conducted service-learning projects in their elementary classrooms during the 2002–2003 school year. Findings. Fifteen of the eighteen elements of service-learning scored within the “almost met” rubric category with a range of 3.05 to 3.75. One citizenship element and all three elements of civic responsibility scored within the “almost met” category. No service-learning elements were in the “met” category. Service-learning projects that concentrated on beach clean up and conservation comprised over 15 percent of the cumulative total of projects reported. Gardening projects contributed to almost 9 percent of the service-learning projects reported by the teachers. Conclusions and recommendations. Beginning and experienced teachers provide service-learning experiences for their elementary students, prepare them to be student citizens, and engage them in the learning process. School districts provide a solid base of support for service-learning projects through in-service training, workshops, and conferences. Funding service-learning grants and projects as a part of the school districts' enhanced standards in civic education is a way to initiate and maintain high quality service-learning projects. Service-learning is not only a valuable teaching tool that builds actively engaged learners and student citizens, but also an excellent opportunity to build and nurture quality relationships with community partners.

AB  - A community school is both a set of partnerships involving the school, parents, and community and a place where services, supports, and opportunities lead to improved student learning, stronger families, and healthier communities. A wide range of models and approaches fit into a basic community-school framework. Although every school is unique, the common theme of partnership with the surrounding community exists, encouraging student learning through community service and service learning. Operating in a public school building, this type of school is open to students, families, and the community before, during, and after school, 7 days a week. This document describes what community schools are and the various activities that take place within them. Some data-collection results suggest students improved their learning and achievement in the community-school environment, along with youth development assets such as prosocial skills and developing a sense of service to the community. Nine community schools are profiled as examples of successful school-parent-community partnerships. The document concludes with an informational listing of some of the key community-school networks across the country, plus a roster of the Coalition for Community Schools steering committee. (RT)

AB  - Serve-America is a national program that was established under the 1990 National and Community Service Act to involve young people in community service and thereby build their understanding of their communities, sense of social responsibility, and commitment to community involvement. In 1992, a 3-year evaluation of Serve-America was initiated to determine its effects on participants, benefits, and cost-effectiveness. The evaluation included observations, document reviews, and participant and control group surveys at 13 local Serve-America program sites. The evaluation established that, as of 1993-94, approximately 434,000 school-aged youths and 90,000 nonparticipant volunteers were participating in Serve-America programs. Serve-America was having positive effects on middle school and high school students and had created new service opportunities in 12 of the 13 intensive study sites. The Serve-America sites studied were producing approximately $3 in direct community benefits for every $1 in program costs. (Thirty tables/figures are included. Appendixes constituting approximately 50% of this document contain the following items: overview of the national evaluation; research and policy background of Serve-America; analysis sample and impact estimation method; definitions of scales and other outcome measures; baseline characteristics of participant and comparison group sample members; Subtitle B1 subgroup analysis; and baseline and follow-up surveys.)

AB  - This document reports on the conduct and findings of a 3-year evaluation of the 1995-96 school year of the Learn and Serve America School and Community-Based Programs, which were initiated to support school and community-based efforts to involve school-aged youth in community service. Well-designed, school-based service-learning programs have a positive impact on young peoples' civic and educational attitudes and school performance while also meeting important community needs. While the impacts on participants tend to fade in the year after initial participation, students who continue their involvement in organized service do continue to show positive effects over the longer-term. When these programs are well-designed and full-implemented, they are more likely to produce impacts on participating youth, demonstrating the importance of continuing the emphasis on improving the quality of these programs to meet the goals of the national community service legislation. Thirty-seven tables and figures are included. The appendixes contain: site selection sampling strategy; impact estimation methods; definitions of scales and other outcome measures; 54 tables detailing postprogram participant impacts, postprogram subgroup impacts, follow-up participant and subgroup effects, and follow-up effects for repeaters and nonrepeaters; and 4 survey instruments.)

AB  - A question was whether service learning implemented in the classroom could improve third grader's reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to show that with the implementation of service learning into guided reading lessons, students would be more successful in their reading comprehension abilities. The study was conducted in an elementary school, and included 40 students in third grade who were eight and nine years old. The study was conducted over a four-week period that contained weekly assessments and lessons as well as a pre and post assessments. Other research studies and literature have shown students involved with service learning perform better academically, have an overall sense of wellbeing, and feel successful in areas outside of academics. Results indicated that over the four-week period, 80% of students showed growth in their reading comprehension skills.

AB  - In this mixed-methods study, we designed and implemented an environmental service-learning program at a public charter school to develop eighth-grade students' environmental literacy. Data sources included the Middle School Environmental Literacy Survey (MSELS), interviews, and students' written work. We extend prior work by analyzing qualitative excerpts using the four dimensions of Cheng and Monroe's (2012) connection to nature scale. Results from qualitative and quantitative analyses showed positive changes in student ecological knowledge and environmental attitudes (connection to nature and empowerment) and some new skills, but no immediate changes in environmentally responsible behaviors. Implications for other educators striving to cultivate civic participation and connection to nature are discussed.

AB  - SOLIDARITY PROJECT USING TECHNOLOGY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES is the result of a pilot initiative for a continuous learning process and educational methodology innovation focused on recreating educational work, interconnecting the general Elementary School curriculum (specifically in the areas of language and communication, mathematics and science) with multiple creative and communicative possibilities provided by information and communication technologies (ICT). With a clear pedagogical intention, ICT are linked to the development of elementary prosocial attitudes, which are part of an active citizenship whose methods favour the school-community relationship by means of a "service-learning" project. At the same time, a type of intervention research was carried out in order to find out how ICT use in the classroom, from a service-learning methodological perspective, may contribute to acquire and develop new cognitive competencies (curriculum), procedures (use of technological tools) and attitudes that strengthen elementary school students and staffs identity in these rural communities. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] "Proyectos solidarios con uso de tecnología en comunidades rurales", correspondió a una iniciativa piloto de formación continua e innovación didáctica, orientada a recrear el quehacer educativo, interrelacionando el currículum de la Enseñanza General Básica (específicamente, los sectores de Lenguaje y Comunicación, Matemática y Ciencias) con las múltiples posibilidades creativas y comunicativas proporcionadas por las Tecnologías de Información y Comunicación (TIC), con una clara intencionalidad pedagógica vinculada al desarrollo de las actitudes prosociales básicas (1), propias de una ciudadanía participativa y cuyas estrategias didácticas favorecen la relación escuela- comunidad a través de proyectos de "aprendizaje servicio". De manera paralela, se desarrolló una investigación (con carácter de intervención) que estuvo orientada a indagar de qué manera el uso de las Tecnologías en el Aula, bajo la metodología del Aprendizaje Servicio (APS), permite contribuir al mejoramiento pedagógico, desarrollando habilidades y/o competencias cognitivas (curriculares); procedimentales (en el uso de las herramientas tecnológicas) y actitudinales (prosociales) que además fortalezcan la identidad de los docentes y alumnos de lro a 6o Básico en sus culturas rurales.

AB  - This report examines the effects of out-of-school time on children during early adolescence, when children go through dramatic physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. It discusses the role of afterschool programs in helping young people navigate early adolescence to successful adulthood. Nine sections look at: (1) "Introduction"; (2) "Early Adolescence in Context" (e.g., the family, media, economic, and educational context); (3) "Engagement in Learning" (e.g., involved parents and emotional attachments to caring adults); (4) "The Landscape of Afterschool Programs" (e.g., school-age care and extended learning); (5) "What to Do After Two P.M." (e.g., self-care and outcomes of extracurricular activities); (6) "Outcomes of Afterschool Programs" (e.g., formal afterschool programs and programs for elementary and middle school students); (7) "Program Strategies" (e.g., experiential education and service learning); (8) "Implementing Effective Programs" (e.g., homework and literacy development); and (9) "Critical Hours." Two appendixes include a brief summary of resiliency research and challenges to evaluation of afterschool programs. (Contains approximately 280 references.) (SM)

AB  - We analyzed the relation between service learning and academic achievement and sought to determine whether characteristics of the service experience mediate academic outcomes. We compared outcomes associated with nonservice-learning, indirect service-learning, and direct service-learning conditions. Students participating in direct service-learning experiences incorporating structured reflections achieved a greater mastery of course learning goals than students participating in indirect service-teaming activities. Students participating in direct service-learning experiences also scored higher on the final exam than nonservice learners.

AB  - The concept of civic-efficacy, as well as its role in post-school outcomes for high school students with disabilities is explored. Service-learning is introduced as a possible intervention for improving the civic-efficacy of high school students with disabilities. The existing literature regarding civic engagement, service-learning, and students with disabilities is critiqued. The results of a mixed methods study with quasi-experimental design analyzing the impact of service-learning activities on the civic-efficacy of youth with disabilities are presented. The findings indicate a significant difference in the civic-efficacy scores of youth who participate in service-learning activities. Qualitative analysis revealed that all the youth participating in the focus groups would like to do more service-learning activities and none of the service-learning sites aligned their projects with the service-learning best practices.

AB  - Minnesota's Youthbuild program helps at-risk youths gain useful job skills while building safe, affordable housing in their neighborhoods and working toward their high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) certificate. In 1999, the Minnesota Legislature appropriated 751,000 dollars per year in Youthbuild funds. The program demonstrates substantial leveraging of matching funds through its coordination with local community, housing, educational, and law enforcement agencies; unions; technical schools; and court services. Youthbuild's quality and compliance with state statutes and labor laws are ensured through regular site visits by representatives of Minnesota's Department of Economic Security. Because it targets youths involved with the criminal justice system and gangs, Youthbuild is not just an excellent school-to-work transition model but also a model program for restorative justice. In 1999, Youthbuild served 399 young people who constructed or renovated 530 units of affordable housing. According to follow-up data collected over 5 years, 70 percent of Youthbuild participants eventually obtained their high school diploma or GED certificate. Participants also improved their leadership skills and self-esteem and reduced their negative attitudes and behaviors regarding school, work, and social interactions. (Case studies of 12 Youthbuild sites throughout Minnesota and a table detailing participants' characteristics and outcomes are included.) (MN)

AB  - This article details the evolution and results of a service-learning project designed to extend cross-cultural relationships via online social networking between students at a U.S. Bureau of Indian Education boarding school and teacher candidates in a required diversity course. The goals for the partnership included helping Native American students identify personal strengths through mentoring relationships, and encouraging teacher education candidates to develop their intercultural communication skills. We assessed the project using qualitative and quantitative measures: identification of significant themes emerging from teacher candidates' reflections; comparison of recurring reflection themes to stages of Bennett's Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity; and statistical analysis of candidate responses on Cushner's Inventory of Cross-Cultural Sensitivity. The analysis reveals challenges and opportunities for student and candidate learning and stimulates questions that shape future directions for service-learning in an increasingly digitized world.

AB  - A multicultural model for children in Grades K through 5 to foster skills needed for success is presented. The learning, living, and working (LLW) group work model focuses on 3 skill sets identified by multiple researchers over the past 30 years as necessary for success in school, relationships, and work. These three skill sets--learning skills, social skills, and cognitive strategies--can be strengthened by participation in the LLW group sessions. The 12-session group uses role play, stories about diversity, and service learning to increase success skills and understanding of diverse cultures. Listening, attending behaviors, cooperative work and play, and the use of story structure are embedded into each session. The goal of group participation is increased academic achievement and positive peer relations. The model was developed to be used in a school setting and may be appropriate for other settings as well, (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data, the study examines critical design elements in developing service learning programs that produce positive attitudinal outcomes for students. Results indicate that students had more positive attitudes toward their academic achievement, self-esteem, teachers, and peers when they participated in programs that rated highly on the four design criteria: duration, location, amount of personal contact with beneficiaries, and focus of the project.

AB  - Storytelling is an ancient communication method and educational tool that has valuable potential in a student-centered learning environment. A critical pedagogy focused on experiential learning is the ideal environment for storytelling to support students' emotional and educational development. The importance of harnessing new tools to build on the changing needs and skills of the 21st century learner is imperative for current and future educators. Research was extended into areas of curriculum design for technological and visual literacies, service learning, student centered learning, mentorship and digital storytelling for social change. A 12-week action research project entitled Girls for a Change conducted at a high school in Calistoga, California. Through observations, a reflective journal and ethno videography the process and outcomes were recorded to create an experiential qualitative research presentation. These findings suggest that adoption of alternative approaches to curriculum design for technological and visual literacy is key for the next generation of learners and world citizens. The paper concludes with an outline of a student-centered curriculum for youth interested in creating digital stories for social change.

AB  - Service-learning has been growing rapidly in American schools and has been embraced as a positive educational practice that engages youth in civic life while promoting authentic learning. Despite the dramatic growth of this practice and the recent national trend to incorporate service-learning in classrooms, there is insufficient empirical research to support it. This one-year study utilized a pre-test and post-test in order to examine the impact and effects of service-learning on high school students' personal growth, social/interpersonal development, and sense of civic responsibility. Participants (n=1812) included students in grades 10 through 12 enrolled in a suburban public high school with an established mandatory service-learning program. This study found that students felt better about service after a year of participation and most students completed more hours than were required. Also discovered was that peer acceptance of and parental feelings toward service-learning was positively associated with adolescents' involvement in service activities. Results indicated that service-learning does impact and effects high school students' civic awareness, engagement, responsibility and increased their comfort level and willingness to help other people.

AB  - The researchers used qualitative and quantitative instruments to measure students' linguistic gains and their opinions and attitudes toward intercultural awareness while studying Spanish as a foreign language under four different pedagogical models: a traditional face-to-face classroom, face-to-face classes with a community-based learning component, face-to-face courses with an online telecollaborative language-learning component, and study abroad. Quantitative findings from two knowledge-based assessments indicated that students' language learning was equivalent in all four pedagogical models. Students' survey responses indicated that they believed that moving beyond traditional instructional models by adding classes with experiential learning boosted their second language acquisition and fueled their curiosity about cultural similarities and differences. Qualitative findings also confirmed that students' engagement was higher in the experiential models.

AB  - Though many decry the decline in political participation and interest, few academic studies present a clear approach to help reverse these trends. This paper examines the impact of high school service-learning programs on students' self-concept, political engagement, and attitudes toward out-groups. The data come from a pre and post survey given to more than 200 high school students (75% female) in 10 different schools. Huber regression was used to assess the impact of student voice in the service-learning project on 6 dependent variables. Results show that if students are involved in service-learning projects in which they have a high degree of voice and ownership, their self-concept and political engagement will improve, and they become more tolerant toward out-groups. Conclusion. In short, having a voice in service-learning programs builds citizenship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is a growing body of work that supports the idea that service-learning is not only an effective way for students to learn or gain core academic skills and knowledge, but it is also an effective way to develop many of the skills and attitudes required of citizens in a democracy (Melchior, 1997). However, the quality of research on service learning is mixed (Conrad and Heiden, 1991). This dissertation is an empirical research study that examines the impact of participation in service-learning on the participants' civic attitudes and orientations. The data for this study comes from two different surveys conducted by the Indiana Department of Education in 2000 and 2001. Both surveys were given in a pretest/posttest format so we could examine the changes in student attitudes, grades and knowledge over time. Surveys were also completed by students who were not engaged in service-learning. Both surveys had a similar design, and the control variables were all identically worded. The questions used on these surveys are drawn primarily from survey questions in education, political science, and sociology. Most have been extensively pre-tested and are valid measures of the underlying concept examined. Schoolwork can be artificial and have no real importance outside of the bounds of the school. In a service-learning project, students have the opportunity to accomplish something with real, often highly significant, effects on other people. The expectation is that civic behavior like service-learning will influence civic attitudes and the intention for future civic behavior. First, I examine whether participation in service-learning can help students develop a greater sense of self-competence and political efficacy. Second, I explore whether participation in service-learning helps to develop social capital. Finally, I look at how participation in service-learning may influence students to be more community oriented and communitarian in their views. The findings are statistically significant, suggesting that service-learning can be an antidote to the growing social disengagement. However, of equal interest, this study suggests that there are project specific factors that can mediate the impact of participation in service-learning. For example, the more leadership those students have in the process, the more that they develop the skills and attitudes of a citizen.

AB  - Cross-Age Tutoring and School Store, two courses combining classroom learning and application of specific skills outside the classroom are evaluated. Students in Cross-Age Tutoring were taught tutoring and communication skills and spent four days per week tutoring at nearby elementary schools; students in School Store were taught business and interpersonal skills and operated an on campus store. These courses are examples of the "Alternatives" or "Service Opportunities" approaches to substance abuse prevention. The general goals of the courses were to foster positive attitudes and behaviors regarding self, peers, and school. These changes were expected to reduce, in subsequent years, student acceptance and use of psychoactive substances. Process data included: a survey of participants at the end of the course, observation of selected course sessions and practica, and interviews with teachers and some students from each course. Both courses (including practica) were well received by the students. Analyses of covariance did not reveal a coherent pattern of treatment effects. The lack of treatment effects was attributed to a possible failure of the courses to require sustained effort for mastery of goals, and to stimulate adequate commitment among the participating students.

AB  - This empirical study explored the impact of service-learning participation on high school students' attitudes toward academic engagement and civic responsibility. This study focused whether a group of high school students who participated in a service-learning project had more positive attitudes toward academic engagement and civic responsibility than their high school peers who did not participate in a service learning project. Data were collected from 67 volunteer students as participants in grades 9–12. A service-learning treatment group of 34 high school students was examined relative to a comparison group of 33 high school students with similar demographic and academic characteristics. The investigator used questionnaires, an oral history/service-learning project, and interviews with the teacher-coordinators of the project to collect the data. The two surveys, one investigating high school students' attitudes about academic engagement, the other investigating high school students' attitudes toward civic responsibility, were administered in a pre-treatment/post-treatment design. There were 90 days between the pre-treatment and post-treatment administrations. A factor analysis of the civic responsibility instrument and multivariate analysis of gain scores were used to compare the means of the total aggregate scores of the treatment and comparison groups. Factor analysis was performed on the academic engagement instrument but it was determined that only the total scores could be used in subsequent analyses. Results were used to determine the efficacy of service-learning as interpreted in student attitudes toward academic engagement and student attitudes toward civic responsibility. The study found no significant difference between the academic engagement and the civic responsibility attitudes of a high school service-learning project group and a high school comparison group with comparable school and similar demographic characteristics. One of the implications for educational practice and policy from the study results is a need to design and implement more powerful studies, studies implemented at many sites rather than just at two sites that were the basis of this study, and studies that investigate the research questions over longer time periods. Although it was not a focus of the study, the investigator concluded that service learning projects such as this might be more effective if they were better aligned with Dewey's principles.

AB  - Post-secondary planning and advising is a multi-faceted approach to preparing adolescents for the rigors of higher education, workforce readiness, and lifelong success. In consideration of the impact that personal and social factors have on successful outcomes, I studied resilience as a protective factor in helping students cope with stress and difficult circumstances that are likely to occur in the post-secondary environment. Also, in light of a tendency of many students in the setting to avoid academic challenge, I studied the relationship between resilience training and an adolescent’s tendency to pursue challenge. In this study, I designed a seminar course for high school seniors in which service learning projects, group discussions, goal setting exercises, and reflections were completed to study the impact of these exercises on developing resilience in adolescents. In this mixed-method analysis, results indicated two themes: 1) relationship building reinforced personal competence, and 2) structured style development and service learning success is dependent on organization of details and completion of small tasks. Broader conclusions were made in that resilience can be trained in adolescents but that resilience development does not correlate to high school academic performance, except in the case of alleviating the symptoms and negative outcomes of senioritis.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a district-wide professional development effort based on a modified Ramp-Up Program, designed to help high school teachers improve the reading skills of their students. Ramp-Up is a two-year course that seeks to accelerate the learning progress of entering high school students who are two or more years behind grade level in English/Language Arts. The course assumes that students can decode text and are reading at least at a Grade 3 level. Activities focus on helping students make rapid progress toward becoming fluent readers, develop wider vocabularies, and comprehend grade level texts through a variety of instructional approaches: (a) Independent Reading (Allington, 2001; Beers, 2003); (b) Read-Aloud/Think-Aloud/ Talk-Aloud (Hahn, 2002; Richardson, 2000); (c) whole-group and small-group reading and writing instruction (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996; Pearson, 1994); and, (d) collaborative learning situations including cross-age tutoring and service learning (Labbo & Teale, 1990). Pilot testing showed that the course had a positive effect on high school students' scores on norm-referenced reading and language arts tests (Muñoz, 2007). In this study, the effectiveness of this professional development model was evaluated using the five levels outlined by Guskey (2000; 2001a; 2001b) for evaluating professional development activities in education. The first level assessed participants' reactions, while the second level assessed participants' learning through pre- and post-measures of knowledge and skills specific to the program. The third level assessed participants' perceptions of organizational support to enable change, and the fourth level focused on participants' use of new knowledge and skills at the classroom level. The fifth and final level assessed the impact on student learning outcomes using results from statewide accountability assessments in reading.

AB  - This is a mixed method study of the effects of active learning techniques on dropout prevention students within a semester-long course on the History of the Vietnam War. The results of the qualitative study are confirmed by data on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, Grade Point Averages and absences over the semester and the following semester. The findings show that one teacher in one class can have a effect on student academic achievement by introducing a student-centered, active curriculum to replace the worksheet and textbook focus that permeates many Dropout Prevention classrooms. The use of email, classroom guests and service learning in a nursing home extends this change to other classes and life outside of school. Students become engaged by active learning techniques, including oral history, demonstrated academic and school behavior changes beyond the semester of the class. Academic success in the class produced greater confidence in school and in the students' lives. The connection to human beings in the curriculum rather than just books and worksheets established an emotional connection to learning that these students had not previously experienced. The emotional connection and the relationships form the basis for the students' success. This study allows Dropout Prevention students to speak in their own voices about their educational experiences before and during the course. The students reflect on the effects of the course on their lives outside of the classroom. Of the thirteen students who participated in the last twelve weeks of the semester, twelve had a cumulative high school Grade Point Average below 2.0. For the semester, twelve earned a GPA over 2.0 in all classes and eleven earned GPAs over 3.0 in all classes. This success was sustained over the following semester. All students earned over a 2.0 GPA and seven earned over a 3.0. Six students who had not passed FCAT and were not going to graduate with a regular diploma did pass FCAT during the spring semester. FCAT scores increased an average of 42 points with some students increasing 82, 67, 58 and 55 points.

AB  - The authors propose a theoretical model of engaged learning for democracy & justice that draws from multicultural education & critical pedagogy, Freireian dialogic education, & Kolb's active, experiential learning. Engaged learning is defined as applying concepts & ideas from the classroom to out-of-class cognition & action. An empirical investigation (n = 203) examines the impact of a course focusing on intergroup relations & social conflict. The course is shown to increase students' structural attributions for racial/ethnic inequality & socio-historical causation. The course also increases students' action orientation away from individual blaming to individual action toward institutional targets, & institutional & societal change. On pre- & post-test measures, engaged learning is shown to mediate the impact of course content & active pedagogy on students' active thinking & understanding of socio-historical causation as well as students' action strategies that promote more tolerance. On post-test only measures, engaged learning mediated effects on socio-structural understanding, understanding others, & learning about conflict. The authors discuss the importance of content, active pedagogy, & engaged learning, & implications for future research & practice on teaching about democracy & social justice. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 39 References.

AB  - This module is designed to introduce professional school counselors, educational leaders, and counselor educators to current research in service-learning and its potential impact on school counseling programs and student achievement. Examples of how school counselors are using service-learning in their comprehensive guidance programs and how counselor educators are using service-learning in pre-service training are also provided. The new vision for professional school counselors broadens the traditional view to include program development, management, and evaluation. Service-learning is one type of programming that can provide hard data regarding the impact of the program on student success and that can elevate the professional school counselors to leadership positions in schools.

AB  - International service-learning (ISL) is a popular way to facilitate student growth in the areas of cross-cultural learning and civic engagement. However, many have questioned whether international trips provide any added value compared to domestic service-learning. Using the context of Alternative Break programs, this study compares student experiences in similarly structured international and domestic service-learning programs. In doing so, it contributes to the larger debate over the relative costs and benefits of international service-learning programs.

AB  - The Florida 4-H Youth Development program provides youth with opportunities to develop life skills through several different delivery methods including clubs, school enrichment, camping, and teen civic engagement and leadership programs. The Florida 4-H Legislature program is a statewide civic engagement program offered to youth ages 14-18 each summer at the state capital in Tallahassee. Outcomes of this program have been measured through life skills demonstrated with the program’s purpose to develop youth into productive, engaged citizens. Youth were also offered the opportunity to engage in leadership roles within the program, including active participation in the planning committee which meets year-round. This study focused on alumni of this program and their engagement in their communities as adults. Social capital can be defined as the intangible resources of social connections and social networks that can be accessed and utilized to create action. Social capital places value on the social networks that exist within communities and between its citizens. Social capital can be built through the interaction between youth and citizens within a community. An online survey was used to determine alumni current community engagement as it relates to the five constructs of social capital: Groups & Networks, Trust & Solidarity, Cooperation, Collective Action, and Empowerment & Political Action. The survey was completed exclusively online and communication was through email, phone, and Facebook. The results of this study determined that service learning in 4-H develops competencies that will be continued into adulthood. Study participants that reported service projects as 4-H members also reported engaging in service as adults. This study reinforces the reflection and application process of Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning model and the “learn by doing” approach through 4-H. The results of this study also determined that 4-H alumni demonstrated higher levels of Empowerment and Political Action and Groups and Networks social capital than a comparison group of non-4-H persons. Empowerment and Political Action competency building was associated with the Florida 4-H Legislature program. Similar competency building opportunities are not found in other Florida 4-H programs. Spurious and mediator relationships were found with remaining social capital constructs and appeared to be associated with years of 4-H membership, educational level, and years of participation in the 4-H Legislature program. The relationships reinforce experiential learning model benefits as well as potential influences 4-H may have on educational choices as adults. Using social capital to measure community impact provides 4-H an opportunity to demonstrate public value as a youth development organization both in development citizenship and communities. As a result of this study it is recommended that Florida 4-H integrate social capital measurement into its evaluation system.

AB  - The article focuses on re-appraisal of service-learning. The author's view on service learning is presented wherein he argues that its attempt and agenda are educationally harmful. He presented examples and situations of bad effects of service-learning, such as it weakens the student's respect for the process of social interaction that is conveyed by a good liberal education and it wastes student's valuable time and other resources. Its definition from different perspective is explored.

AB  - Purpose: To examine whether participation in a school-sponsored community youth service program reduces self-reported violent behaviors among young urban adolescents. Methods: A total of 972 seventh- and eighth-grade students at two large, urban, public middle schools were surveyed at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. One school was assigned to interventions and the other served as a control. All students at the intervention school received the Reach for Health classroom curriculum that included a 10-lesson unit focusing on violence prevention. In addition, approximately half the students were randomly assigned by classroom to participate in the Reach for Health Community Youth Service program (CYS). Under the guidance of teachers and community nurses, these students spent several hours each week providing service in local health care agencies. Regression analyses were used to assess the influence of treatment condition on violent behavior outcomes. Results: Comparing students in the curriculum-only and curriculum-plus-CYS interventions to the control group, there is a statistically significant interaction (p <.03) among grade, CYS participation, and violence at follow-up. Eighth-grade CYS students reported significantly less violence at follow-up than students in the control school, taking into account baseline level of risk behavior, gender, ethnicity, and social desirability (p <.04). There was no significant difference between controls and students in the curriculum-only condition. Comparing students in the CYS intervention to the curriculum-only condition within the intervention school, the grade by intervention interaction again is significant (p <.05). Eighth-grade CYS students-who received the broadest CYS experience-reported less violence at follow-up than their curriculum-only counterparts. Conclusion: When delivered with sufficient intensity, school programs which couple community service with classroom health instruction can have a measurable impact on violent behaviors of a population of young adolescents at high risk for being both the perpetrators and victims of peer violence. Community service programs may be an effective supplement to curricular interventions and a valuable part of multicomponent violence prevention programs. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 1998.

AB  - Evaluated the sustained effectiveness of a middle school service learning intervention on reducing sexual initiation and recent sex among urban African American and Latino adolescents from 7th grade through the 10th grade. During the fall of seventh grade and again in eighth grade, students were randomly assigned by classroom to participate either in community youth service (CYS) or not (controls). Service learning is an educational strategy that couples meaningful service in the community with classroom instruction. Students in both intervention and control conditions received classroom health lessons. Surveys were conducted at seventh grade baseline and at the end of 10th grade, approximately 2 years after intervention. Self-reported sexual behaviors of youths who had participated in CYS were compared with those of controls receiving classroom curriculum alone. A service learning intervention that combines community involvement with health instruction can have a long-term benefit by reducing sexual risk taking among urban adolescents.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sustained effectiveness of a middle school service learning intervention on reducing sexual initiation and recent sex among urban African-American and Latino adolescents from 7th grade through the 10th grade. METHODS: During the fall of seventh grade and again in eighth grade, students were randomly assigned by classroom to participate either in community youth service (CYS) or not (controls). Service learning is an educational strategy that couples meaningful service in the community with classroom instruction. Students in both intervention and control conditions received classroom health lessons. Surveys were conducted at seventh grade baseline and at the end of 10th grade, approximately 2 years after intervention. Self-reported sexual behaviors of youths who had participated in CYS were compared with those of controls receiving classroom curriculum alone (n = 195). RESULTS: CYS participants were significantly less likely than controls to report sexual initiation (2 years CYS, odds ratio [OR] = 0.32; 1 year, OR = 0.49) as well as recent sex (2 years CYS, OR = 0.39; 1 year CYS, OR = 0.48). Among those who were virgins at seventh grade, 80% of males in the curriculum-only condition had initiated sex, compared with 61.5% who received 1 year of CYS, and 50% who received 2 years. Among females, the figures were 65.2%, 48.3%, and 39.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A service learning intervention that combines community involvement with health instruction can have a long-term benefit by reducing sexual risk taking among urban adolescents.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of service-learning activities on the sensitivity to social problems of students aged 12 and 14. A mixed method was implemented which combines qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques. The Scale for Sensitivity to Social Problems was performed to determine the sensitivity of the young people to social problems. The results of the study showed that there was a meaningful difference in terms of sensitivity to social problems between the students involved in service-learning activities and those who did not participate in these activities. Furthermore, it was also found that service-learning activities have positive influence on the character and social development of the students.

Participants included a total of 31 10th grade students at Pearl Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School who were involved in the YEP as mentees. Several indicators were used including the Resilience Scale, a health knowledge questionnaire, youths' academic records, and YEP attendance records. Data analyses included paired samples t-tests, multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA), and Pearson's correlations. Results of the present study indicate that mentees involved in the YEP showed significant increases in their level of resilience from pre to post assessment and showed significant gains in their knowledge of health-related concepts. No significant differences were observed for mentees cumulative GPA's for the year following their involvement in the YEP. Additionally, several significant relations among dependent variables were found. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the YEP may have a positive impact on youth who are consistently involved in its programs and activities. The author provides some recommendations for program improvement and directions for future research.

AB  - This article illustrates how community service-learning can be defined and implemented as a group inquiry project in which students apply academic knowledge and social problem-solving skills. The authors examined eleven different community service-learning projects put into practice by elementary and middle school teachers who participated in CiviConnection, a national civic education program. They also explored how the teachers' practices were related to their perspectives on citizenship education, as the national CiviConnections program was designed to align with the reflective inquiry perspective by integrating historical inquiry in community service-learning. From the reflective inquiry perspective, they identified four elements of service-learning as a group inquiry project and analyzed eleven class projects to see how they incorporated the four components: (1) identifying issues and defining problems, (2) studying issues in-depth while using disciplinary modes of investigation, (3) developing action plans through decision-making processes, and (4) developing personalized knowledge through reflection. The authors discuss the study results' implications and examine opportunities to consider how community service-learning should be developed and implemented as a group inquiry project in which students develop personalized knowledge about community issues through discipline-based inquiry skills and decision-making processes.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether a student's self concept will change significantly as a result of participating in a service learning or community service project. Data was collected through pretesting and posttesting of secondary school students using the Multidimensional Self Concept Scale (MSCS). Three intact classes of students in grades 10-12 participated in the six-week duration of the project. Group one, the control group, was given the MSCS as a pretest and posttest. Group two was given the MSCS as a pretest followed by specifically planned classroom activities which prepared them for the service learning activity. The group was then chaperoned to a local nursing facility where students worked with nursing home residents. Reflection activity followed the participants' experiences. Group three was pretested and posttested and then participated in the community service activity. They did not experience the classroom and reflection activities. Data was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and the Wilks' Lambda statistic. It was found there was no statistical difference in the global self concept scores of students after participating in the service learning or community service project. It can be concluded that the global self concept of high school age students is not affected by their participation in service learning or community service projects limited to 21 hours of volunteer contact hours within a six-week duration.

AB  - This study explored the impact of one intergenerational service-learning experience on eight-to ten-year-old students' attitudes and knowledge about senior citizens. It was designed to look at the relationship between intergenerational service-learning experiences for public school elementary students and their attitudes and knowledge of senior citizens before and after service-learning experiences. In addition, the study compared the knowledge and attitudes about senior citizens of another class to the class who participated in service-learning activities. The importance of intergenerational service-learning opportunities comes from the change in society as reflected not only by cultural differences, but also generational differences. As the population's average age increases, the nation's need to find connections among all generations increases. This study aimed to provide a base of research to point out the misconceptions children had about the elderly. It also explored the impact of intergenerational service-learning opportunities, in terms of providing a more accurate picture of our senior citizens to younger generations. The results of the study indicated that the intervention did not have any apparent influence over the general knowledge scores of both the experimental and control groups. The intervention did however appear to have an impact on the experimental group's specific knowledge of the senior citizens they were directly working with. These results were supported through experimental teacher and nursing home staff interviews and experimental focus group comments to help triangulate the data and analysis of the positive change in knowledge of senior citizens experienced by the experimental students. In addition, the intergenerational service-learning activities did have an impact on the experimental group's attitude towards the senior citizens. These findings suggest the need to utilize intergenerational service-learning activities in order to promote more positive attitudes towards senior citizens and in helping to provide more realistic pictures of the elderly. Intergenerational service-learning activities provide opportunities for people of different generations to get to know one another and to break down misconceptions of aging. Intergenerational service-learning activities are great ways to connect the generations by building positive attitudes towards senior citizens and increasing knowledge of the aging process.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether students would show positive behavior and attitude changes toward the environment and civic engagement after they participated in a thirty-hour community service learning art program. Data collected from the program in the forms of a pre-test post-test instrument, written essays, and weekly log were analyzed to determine if student behavior and attitude had changed. Students participated in the following service learning experiences: a marine habitat aquarium tour; a wetland restoration; a beach clean-up; and a visit to a recycling center. In the classroom, students reflected on what was learned by creating wetland birds out of recycled newspaper and paper mache. Analysis of the quantitative data, although positive, could not prove statistical significance. However, the qualitative analysis found that the overall program had a positive affect on student attitude toward the environmental issues. As a result, recommendations were made for future studies.

AB  - Schools are a logical and important setting for conducting programs aimed at preventing a myriad of problems among youth. The transition from middle school to high school represents an important developmental period linked to a broad range of risk factors typically associated with onset and escalation of alcohol and drug use. By intervening during this period, key risk factors can be reduced and protective factors can be enhanced, with the net effect being a sustained reduction in antecedents and mediators of harmful behaviors. Curriculum dose and content of each program differ, but one of the features that distinguishes Peer Group Connection (PGC) from the other programs is its focus on older age peers as the main mode of delivery to incoming high school students during their period of transition. PGC intensively trains peer leaders to deliver the program to ninth-grade students. Peer leaders are trained through participation in a leadership retreat and a daily credit-bearing course. PGC also develops a team of school stakeholders to support the implementation, sustainability, and expansion of the program. In addition, PGC includes family night events that directly involve family members in the program and a daylong (4–5 hours) activity day for ninth-grade students that focuses on team building. The program incorporates a service learning component and booster sessions in the sophomore year to reinforce learning from the freshman year. The theoretical framework, curriculum, and evaluations of PGC are discussed in this chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine the extent to which remediation/enrichment, character education, and service learning improved secondary students' self-concept and raised their level of academic achievement. Specifically, the study, which took place in a Southwestern rural school district, examined the extent to which the Academic Prep, a program designed to provide secondary students with remediation/enrichment, character education, and service learning, improved students' self-concept and raised their level of academic achievement. Three types of research processes were used in the collection of data for the study: test data, surveys, and anecdotal data. The researcher looked for common themes and trends resulting from all of the data collected and analyzed. Data was compared to determine the impact of remediation/enrichment, character education, and service learning on secondary students' academic achievement and self-concept. Based on a conceptual framework for unproved student self-concept and academic achievement, the study described the intervention and stated the purpose, process, and findings of the study. The intervention consisted of implementing the Academic Prep program for thirty minutes during the school day, at Jemez Valley High School, in an attempt to improve students' self-concept and academic achievement through the following learning opportunities: character education, service learning, and remediation/enrichment; depending on students' needs. The findings of the study are consistent with the literature on academic achievement and self-concept, remediation/enrichment, character education, and service learning. Specifically, the findings support the positive role that remediation/enrichment, character education, and service learning play in unproving students' self-concept and academic achievement.

AB  - Each day to and from school, Watsonville teens pass over one of California's largest remaining coastal freshwater wetlands—and many do not recognize this rare habitat or realize that they have an impact on it. To change their view, in 2006 the Monterey Bay Aquarium, in partnership with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District and several community groups, developed WATCH—Watsonville Area Teens Conserving Habitats. WATCH is a year-long, service-learning program that connects high school students, mostly Latino, to their local watershed, while enhancing their science knowledge, English-language learning, and leadership and job skills. The program's goal is to empower teens and to create positive change within the community. Our ongoing evaluation and improvement of WATCH has occurred primarily through surveys, concept maps and retrospective storyboards. This article describes the program, our use of age-appropriate and culturally sensitive evaluation methods, and our findings regarding the program's impact on teens' connection to nature and their community.

AB  - Despite a growing consensus that civic education is an important aspect of political socialization, little research has prospectively examined how gains made during civics courses are maintained after high school. This study used a quasi-experimental design to examine longer-term effects of the Student Voices program, which was originally evaluated in Philadelphia public high schools during the 2002-2003 school year. Following the 2004 presidential election, researchers recontacted students who had participated in the program for one or two semesters and students who had been in control civics classrooms. A structural equation model indicated that students who experienced two semesters of the program reported greater self-efficacy for political participation and that this effect carried over to increased political attentiveness as well as to knowledge of candidate positions. In addition, political attentiveness increased knowledge and voting in the election. However, neither knowledge nor efficacy had direct effects on voting once attentiveness was controlled. The results suggest that a supplementary civics education program such as Student Voices can increase subsequent participation in politics by building long-term gains in political self-efficacy and skills in using the news media to follow government and political affairs.

AB  - The article discusses how service learning can improve education for middle school students. The authors comment on how middle school experiences can lead students to drop out of high school and note that many students drop out due to lack of engagement with classes. They suggest service learning can change student attitudes regarding education by offering lessons that correspond with their development, emphasize active learning and peer relations and connect curriculum content with real-world situations. Service learning also promotes student and school relationships with communities and student empowerment.

AB  - 21st century skills are vital for students' preparation to successfully live and work as adults in the 21st century. Given the prominence and importance of the 21st century skills, there is a need for more extensive research regarding community activities, service learning, and the development of 21st century skills. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of self-reported improvement in 21st century skill development of youth puppy raisers after participating in a year-long service-oriented experience in the following areas: (a) interdisciplinary skills, (b) learning and innovation skills, (c) information, media, and technology skills, and (d) life and career skills. A quantitative survey instrument was designed based on the Partnership for 21st Century Skills Framework and named The Peace Inventory of 21st Century Skills. The instrument contains four skill domains consisting of 23 total survey items. A four point Likert scale was used to collect self-reported improvement ratings for each of the 23 items. The results from 113 individuals who began puppy raising for Guide Dogs for the Blind after January 1, 2005 while under the age of 18 were collected and analyzed. The means and standard deviations for each of the four skill domains were calculated, and a repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine if a significant difference existed between the four skill domains. The findings revealed that participants attributed improvement in each of the four 21st century skill domains from the experience as a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs for the Blind. This service-learning experience had the strongest reported impact on both life and career skills and learning and innovation skills. The findings from this research further support and strengthen the literature regarding the benefits of service-learning experiences on youth development, especially in regards to 21st century skills.

AB  - This study contributes to more effective practice by assessing how student outcomes are affected by amount and kind of contact with service beneficiaries, and frequency and variety of reflection activities. In particular, the impacts of these pedagogical variations are examined in relation to students' (1) personal social values, (2) civic attitudes, (3) perceived course effects on civic attitudes and (4) self-reported academic benefits. Results suggest service-learning is more effective as a civic and academic pedagogy when students have (1) at least fifteen to twenty hours of service, (2) frequent contact with the beneficiaries of their service, (3) weekly in-class reflection, (4) ongoing and summative written reflection, and (5) discussions of their service experiences both with the instructors and the site supervisors.

AB  - Although the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 created new instructional intervention practices, reading and writing scores across K-12 and postsecondary levels continue to reflect stagnant achievement outcomes. The research questions in this study concerned the effect of a northern Michigan middle school language arts intervention, in the form of a service-learning project, on student academic achievement as indicated by Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) reading scores. The service-learning intervention provided an educational opportunity for students to learn through personal experiences based on David Kolb's experiential learning theory. An experimental research design was used for the study where 70 randomly selected 6th-grade language arts students participated in a 9-week service-learning project. After data collection, the students were grouped by their performance assessment scores into 4 categories. Descriptive statistics and a 1-way ANOVA were conducted to examine possible differences between group means. Nonsignificant results showed that the service-learning project had no effect on MEAP reading scores from 2011 [F(3,66) = 0.392, p = 1.00] and 2012 [F(3,66) = 0.426, p = .735] as measured by a performance assessment. An outcome-based program evaluation studied the effectiveness of the service-learning project on student academic achievement. Findings were presented to the targeted audience; a continuation of a program evaluation for 2013-2014 was recommended. The findings led to social change through community partnerships and the development of teacher professional development opportunities, which included training for classroom service-learning program implementation and classroom alternative performance-based tasks.

AB  - The article discusses a report focusing on how service learning programs can prevent dropouts in high school education. The report "Engaged for Success: Service Learning As a Tool for High School Dropout Prevention" discusses how service learning, in which community service is incorporated into school curricula, can improve academic achievement and teach students about citizenship, leadership and team work. It suggests that service learning provides students with relevant educational experiences and increases student interest in lessons, qualities which a survey of students revealed are key factors in student retention. The survey indicated that a majority of students favor service learning classes. The report suggests service learning should be increased in U.S. educational programs.

AB  - A 3-year community service learning program was established at a small high school in Maine. The program aims to provide a unifying focus for a fragmented student population, address community problems, and increase students' self-esteem and feelings of being meaningful members of their community. In grade 9, teachers of every subject design exploratory community learning experiences for all students. During grade 10, integrated teams of heterogeneously grouped students meet monthly with teams of teachers to participate in nine seminars. These seminars include field trips to potential service learning sites and community meetings and culminate in the development of individual service learning action plans. In grade 11, students implement their action plans, performing a minimum of 50 hours of hands-on work, and prepare a portfolio demonstrating the outcomes of their learning. A survey was administered to 64 students at the end of the 3-year program and to 70 seniors who had not participated in the program. The two groups differed significantly in reported school belonging and willingness to participate in one's community and help others. Both groups reported relatively high self-esteem, regardless of program participation. Seventy-five percent of the treatment group agreed that they could make a difference in the world, and this attitude was correlated with self-esteem. Self-esteem was also correlated with school belonging. An appendix contains the student survey. (SV)

AB  - This article presents research findings from a pilot study of the use of service-learning in an intermediate-high class ({''}Spanish Language and Culture for Heritage Speakers{''}) in the fall semesters of 2010 and 2011. Students reported gains in the areas of communication skills, dispositional learning, language, identity formation, and identification and solidarity with Latino communities of the greater Chicago area. The author argues that service-learning in this context not only serves the goals of the discipline of teaching Spanish language and Hispanic cultures, but that it is also potentially transformative for students. Service-learning engages with social justice education, as well as education for democracy, pointing the discipline in a promising direction as Latino student enrollments continue to grow in the years to come.

AB  - This article proposes the use of a conceptual framework for developing digital skills at school using Service Learning and Project-Based learning approaches. In this context, an important role is played by 'digital citizenship' understood as a stimulus for participation in the community also through social software. The author also presents the results of a project carried out by students in technical high school on a very sensitive local issue: the installation of new antennas for mobile phones and the dangers of radiation. The students measured cell phone emissions and created videos that were distributed in a blog, accessed by both the local community and the general online community. The project results were positive on various levels, both at school, evidenced by an improvement in student performance and the motivation to learn, and socially, by satisfying the knowledge needs of the community.

AB  - Bridge Builders is a 2-year program intended to develop leadership in high school students. Programmatic goals include enhancing the participants' understanding of other racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomic groups, gender awareness, social responsibility, and the value of community service. Bridge Builders participants confronted community problems such as racial discrimination, homelessness, educational inequity, drug abuse, and poverty. These young leaders are expected to influence others in their schools and communities. Their awareness of and commitment to solving community problems should produce lasting benefits for the society. A survey of former participants (N=151) was conducted to study the impact of the program over its 10-year history. Attitudes of participants with regard to leadership, community service, communications, human relations, and Bridge Builder activities were studied. A set of seven questions inviting comments was also included. A data analysis is provided with demographics, descriptive data on questions, and analysis by gender, race, age, education, and period of involvement. Differences by current vocation (job category) are presented. Answers to the qualitative questions are discussed, and conclusions presented. Overall the program was seen as effective; however, many suggestions for improvements were reported. Recommendations are listed. Includes letter and instrument used to gather data. (Contains 12 tables.) (EMK)

AB  - Evidence does not exist that documents the effectiveness of Louisiana 4-H community service-learning projects. The purpose of this study is to compare self-reported perceptions of personal and leadership life skills development of Louisiana high school 4-H leadership activity participants by whether they participate in the 4-H Junior Leader Club (JLC) and/or the CHARACTER COUNTS! (CC) peer teaching program. The target population for this study was all high school students who participated in either the CC peer teaching program or the 4-H JLC. Therefore, this study was limited to those parishes that have both a CC peer teaching program and a 4-H JLC. A survey instrument was mailed to 321 high school students with 165 surveys returned. The survey instrument for this study was the Leadership and Personal Development Inventory (LPDI) developed by Richard Carter (1989). Louisiana high school 4-H leadership participants are typically 15 years old, female, white, live in towns with a population under 10,000 and receive mostly A's and B's in high school. Mean scores for the LPDI indicated that participants agreed they demonstrated the items on the inventory. Results showed no difference existed in the perceived personal and leadership life skills development among the three groups on the LPDI. Membership in 4-H JLC explained a small amount of the variance (2.4%) in the development of personal and leadership life skills after variance in personal and demographic variables were controlled. Further research should consider using the researcher's reconfigured scales from Carter's (1989) Leadership and Personal Development Inventory survey to study 4-H participants involved in a more structured 4-H experience that has requirements to complete membership.

AB  - By and large, scholars of electoral behavior and civil society consider education to be the key predictor of civic participation. Indeed, civic education is held to be a fundamental institution of all deliberative democracies. Yet after decades of empirical research, we still know little about the causal mechanisms through which education fosters political participation, and more generally, “good American citizens.” Recently, scholars and educators have suggested that practical lessons about local politics and participation in extracurricular activities—collectively referred to as service learning—are the most promising educational tools for enhancing civic development. I use two field experiments with high school students to test whether these activities actually affect civic knowledge, attitudes and behavior. The primary advantage of an experimental approach is that it creates the conditions necessary for unbiased causal inference. Accordingly, my results speak to certain issues of cause and effect in civic education with greater certainty than previous research. This study is additionally novel in the measures it uses to gauge civic engagement. Many scholars have characterized minority students as possessing less political knowledge and participating less in civic organizations than their white counterparts. These findings may partially reflect the inability of researchers to measure a broad spectrum of extra-electoral behavior in urban areas. To test this hypothesis, I incorporate more comprehensive and culturally sensitive indicators of civic involvement than those used by prior research. Contrary to the hopes of recent theorists, my findings show the effects of local service learning to be small and elusive. On the other hand, my refined measures of participation reveal some previously neglected, but potentially inspiring sources of civic engagement in the ghetto. Only time and future experimentation will tell whether these popular activities represent a more successful means of mobilizing urban youth for political activism.

AB  - This article examines whether the motive behind community service performed during high school-either voluntary or required-influences engagement in volunteer work during the young adult years. Using a sample of students from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (N = 9,966), service work in high school is linked with community service in young adult- hood. The findings show that participation in community service declines substantially in the 2 years following high school graduation but then rebounds slightly once members of the sample reach their mid-20s. In general, community service participation in high school was related to volunteer work both 2 and 8 years after high school graduation. However, those who were required to participate in community service while in high school were only able to sustain involvement 8 years after graduation if they reported that their participation was voluntary. Strengths and limitations of the analysis as well as implications for youth policy are discussed.

AB  - This study measured the emotional responses of students to common service learning activities. Two hypotheses focused on (1) expected changes in the mean emotion scores and (2) expected differences in individual responses. Results showed significant increases in Surprise, Anxiety and Distress and individual differences in Contempt, Disgust and Fear. The findings suggest that educational institutions have a responsibility to adequately prepare students for service learning experiences. There is also a need to accommodate the different sensitivities students have when service learning is required.

AB  - Currently, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 mandates K-3 teachers to base teaching methods on scientifically based reading research so that all children will read at grade level by the end of third grade. The 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress reports 38% of the nation's fourth graders read below basic level. The struggling reader who experiences a reading gap in third grade faces an even wider gap when moving on to fourth grade. This study examined the effects of a literacy-based service-learning program for struggling fourth grader readers. Ten fourth graders assisted ten third graders with reading. Data was gathered through summative and formative assessments, student journals, reading coach/researcher journal, surveys, and interviews. The main goal of the intervention was to raise the oral reading fluency scores of the ten fourth graders with the lowest oral reading fluency rates. The study was also designed to increase the students' motivation for reading. Results indicated that the ten fourth grade students did increase their oral reading fluency scores. During the eight weeks of meeting with the fourth graders, motivation for reading was evident with the show of enthusiasm for the service-learning connections with the third graders. This literacy-based service-learning intervention contributes to the lack of research directed toward the neglected population of struggling fourth grade readers.

AB  - Required community service is becoming more prevalent in the lives of high school students in the United States today. In 1992, 8 percent of high school students attended schools that require service, and that number doubled to 16 percent in 1996. Proponents of required service propose that it facilitates social development in participants. This study examined the process by which required community service facilitates adolescent identity development by drawing on Youniss and Yates' (1997) developmental theory. It describes a community service program that required all students to perform service. Students chose their own service project, and most performed their service individually. Data included questionnaires, participant observations over the course of two years, and essays written as reflections of service experiences. Analyses focused on the process by which required service may facilitate adolescent identity development. Because of the process approach, analyses were performed in three steps. First, analyses tested to see if antecedents or background variables predicted the type of service students chose for their projects (serving the needy and interacting with those served). Next, multiple regression was used to see if the type of service students performed predicted their perceptions of developmental opportunities (Agency and Cognitive Challenge). Finally, analyses of growth curves determined the extent to which type of service and developmental opportunities influenced identity exploration (transcendent reflection), and change over time on future voluntarism, future political participation, and ego identity. Results indicated serving the needy and interacting with those served was related to students' perceptions of cognitive challenge, and interacting with those served predicted high levels of agency. The final analyses indicated that serving the needy stimulated identity exploration within the context of the service project and society. Further, growth curve analyses indicated that both type of service and developmental opportunities predicted change over time on variables measuring identity commitment. Overall, students who served the needy and interacted with those they served were more likely to benefit. However, this study indicated that more research into this process is necessary to understand it more fully. The final chapter discusses the types of data that would further elucidate this process.

AB  - A number of scholars have identified a crisis in the field of education. Namely, students today are more self-absorbed and individualistic than ever before. In other words, they have few social commitments and lack a sense of community. This lack of social responsibility is particularly problematic in Colombia, where a privileged few enjoy all the spoils and the elite youth are groomed as the future leaders of the country. For many, hope is all but lost on these socially irresponsible students. On the other hand, some planners and critics believe that service-learning--which connects community service to the classroom--is a remedy for this lack of social solidarity. With this in mind, service-learning has become increasingly popular during the past decade all over the globe, and particularly in Latin American countries such as Colombia. This research project is an evaluation of the service-learning program at one of the most elite high schools in Colombia. The project has two specific aims: (1)to document the impact of the program on the attitudes and behaviors of the students and (2)to assess the quality of the implementation of the program. In order to achieve these aims, three data collection methods-questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups -- were used to paint a holistic picture of the program. Furthermore, a theoretical model of service-learning was developed as a benchmark to evaluate the program. The results revealed that the service-learning program was having a minimal impact on students' attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - A number of scholars have identified a crisis in the field of education. Namely, students today are more self-absorbed and individualistic than ever before. In other words, they have few social commitments and lack a sense of community. This lack of social responsibility is particularly problematic in Colombia, where a privileged few enjoy all the spoils and the elite youth are groomed as the future leaders of the country. For many, hope is all but lost on these socially irresponsible students. On the other hand, some planners and critics believe that service-learning--which connects community service to the classroom--is a remedy for this lack of social solidarity. With this in mind, service-learning has become increasingly popular during the past decade all over the globe, and particularly in Latin American countries such as Colombia. This research project is an evaluation of the service-learning program at one of the most elite high schools in Colombia. The project has two specific aims: (1) to document the impact of the program on the attitudes and behaviors of the students and (2) to assess the quality of the implementation of the program. In order to achieve these aims, three data collection methods–questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups—were used to paint a holistic picture of the program. Furthermore, a theoretical model of service-learning was developed as a benchmark to evaluate the program. The results revealed that the service-learning program was having a minimal impact on students' attitudes and behaviors. In fact, the analysis showed that in many instances the program was simply reinforcing stereotypes and solidifying the social division in Colombia. The failure to achieve the desired outcomes may have been due to the fact that the program did not fulfill many of the required expectations of service-learning. In the final chapter, specific recommendations are given to improve the program.

AB  - Elementary Options (EO) is a behavior support program in rural southeast Idaho for students in grades K-5 with emotional or behavioral difficulties. Instead of imposing curriculum or classroom strategies, EO works in conjunction with the Department of Health and Welfare to offer a systematic approach to managing problem behaviors with existing school personnel. Maintaining students in general education environments is its strongest goal. Program participation is triggered when the teacher requests support and submits observations and data. Additional information determines the appropriate level of service, after which intervention and monitoring begin. The program uses a five-step plan of escalating levels of support. The first four levels of support are delivered in the student's regular school setting and consist of classroom support, counseling, coaching and tracking, and service learning, respectively. The fifth level is placement in a half-day alternative classroom. The student's counselor, parents, principal, general education teacher, observer, coach, special education teacher, and the EO coordinator meet regularly to discuss the student's behavior and ongoing assessment. Since September 2000, students demonstrated average monthly increases of 5 percent in their ability to use independent learning behaviors, 2 percent in social skills, and 6 percent in ability to meet target academic and social behaviors. School discipline incidents dropped from 1.6 per student per month to 0.3. (TD)

AB  - School science laboratory classes and hands-on public engagement activities share many common aims and objectives in terms of science learning and literacy. This article describes the development and evaluation of a microbiology public engagement activity, "The Good, the Bad and the Algae", from a school laboratory activity. The school activity was developed as part of an educational resource which aimed to promote practical microbiology in the classroom. The public engagement activity was derived locally for National Science and Engineering Week 2011 and was subsequently adapted for a national science and engineering fair (The Big Bang 2012). The aim of the session was to raise awareness of the importance of algae and to encourage hands-on laboratory examination in a fun and informal manner. Evaluation of the first event, delivered in a workshop format, helped shape the educational resource before publication. The second event was modified to enable delivery to a larger audience. Both events were successful in terms of enjoyment and engagement. Over 2200 people participated in the Big Bang activity over three days, with evaluation indicating 80% of participants had increased awareness/knowledge of algae after the event. The success of both iterations of the activity demonstrates that it is possible to transform a simple school activity into an exciting and effective public engagement activity.

AB  - There's a lot of talk about saving the environment and going green these days. But the challenge is to turn the words into action, and that includes getting young students to become part of the discussion about sustainability. The Texas-based Rainwater Environmental Alliance for Learning (REAL) School Gardens is cultivating success by providing students with opportunities to design, install and sustain urban gardens, which then serve as classrooms where they learn subjects like biology and science while strengthening their communities. This article highlights the positive outcome of the REAL School Gardens on students particularly on the development of sustainability, on their healthy eating habits and on the community as a whole. It discusses how the REAL School Gardens can be successful, powerful teaching tool in engaging children.

AB  - This study focused on the role of school-based required community service in promoting adolescents' prosocial behavior and intended future civic involvement when service is differentiated by types and by adolescents' perceived experience. A longitudinal data set of high school students (N = 603) was analyzed to investigate the developmental steps from types of service through intended civic behavior. Results showed that service involving direct interaction with people in need led students to judge that they had made contributions to sponsoring organizations and, consequently, altered their self-awareness. In turn, changed awareness enhanced reports of helping behavior toward strangers, which then led to the likelihood of future volunteering and of voting, working on a political campaign, and demonstrating for a cause. Additional causal analyses supported the directional sequence that began with service experiences, led to prosocial behavior, and eventuated in intended future civic involvement.

AB  - Over the past few decades, service-learning has surged in popularity. Although most programs are implemented in high school and college classrooms, service-learning has the potential for great impact in middle school. The present article evaluates a pilot service-learning program for fifth- and seventh-grade (N = 86) children in a large, urban, midwestern city. For this project, a service-learning curriculum was developed, implemented, and assessed. Findings indicate that, relative to students in the control group, students participating in the service-learning curriculum demonstrated significantly higher scores on the measure of Leadership. Several Grade × Intervention interactions suggested stronger effects for fifth-grade students. A measure of Acceptance of Diversity did not show any significant differences. Implications and recommendations for developing future programs are discussed.

AB  - Two courses in the field of child and family development are used to exemplify the impact of community-based service-learning on student outcomes. The courses, Developmental Dysfunction and Divorce and Remarriage, are structurally described from course conception to evaluation following five processes: establishing partnership, crafting service goals, instituting students' support mechanisms, designing an integrative curriculum, and creating assessment measures. Students' outcomes were presented using grade average comparison, students' testimony, and reflections. Students who participated in a community-based service-learning course scored higher than students in other classes. They also indicated gains in knowledge, interpersonal skills, civic responsibility, caring, and career and personal growth. Community partners outcomes were assessed based on attrition rate, partners' recruitment of others, continued interest, and written feedback.

AB  - This dissertation studies the impact of after school clubs and service learning activities on students' beliefs and attitudes towards citizenship (civic participation in a democracy), civic engagement, and political and social participation. This study focuses on two different organizations: Spectrum, a Gay-Straight alliance; and AMIGOS, a service learning program. Both environments presented students with opportunities to engage in civic activities, while informing their understanding of citizenship (civic participation). The purpose of this study was twofold. First, I wanted to better understand the impact of after school clubs and service learning activities on students' beliefs towards civic participation and civic and political engagement. Second, using as my lens such issues as empowerment, inequality, oppression, domination, and alienation, I sought to gauge whether participation in programs like the ones above altered preconceived ideas students held about others. A mixed-methods approach (quantitative/qualitative) was used to examine the impact of participation in AMIGOS and Spectrum. Data sources included participant interviews, surveys, field notes, observations of training/meetings, and documents. Data were first analyzed separately and then triangulated to investigate consistency in the findings. Data from the observations were analyzed at three different stages: (1) analysis done as an on-going process while reflecting on what was observed; (2) analysis after the study was completed; (3) analysis performed over the summer, after some time and at some distance from the study. AMIGOS provided volunteers with ideal opportunities to build a sense of civic and political engagement in youth. AMIGOS integrated key elements identified by current research: it provided opportunities for teaching about civic and political engagement, and provided opportunities for reflection. In addition, it incorporated real activities: students spent from six to eight weeks in a host community trying to effect positive change. Finally, their efforts were supported, recognized and praised by family members, the communities they come from, and the communities they were assisting. Spectrum also had the potential to build a sense of civic and political engagement in their members. However, they faced challenges that risked lessening their potential impact. The club engaged in "teaching" about civic and political and engagement and provided the members with opportunities to engage in real activities. However, they did not always receive the support and recognition of their communities (school) or families, and often faced opposition to achieving their goal of equal LGBT rights.

AB  - This dissertation studies the impact of after school clubs and service learning activities on students' beliefs and attitudes towards citizenship (civic participation in a democracy), civic engagement, and political and social participation. This study focuses on two different organizations: Spectrum, a Gay-Straight alliance; and AMIGOS, a service learning program. Both environments presented students with opportunities to engage in civic activities, while informing their understanding of citizenship (civic participation). The purpose of this study was twofold. First, I wanted to better understand the impact of after school clubs and service learning activities on students' beliefs towards civic participation and civic and political engagement. Second, using as my lens such issues as empowerment, inequality, oppression, domination, and alienation, I sought to gauge whether participation in programs like the ones above altered preconceived ideas students held about others. A mixed-methods approach (quantitative/qualitative) was used to examine the impact of participation in AMIGOS and Spectrum. Data sources included participant interviews, surveys, field notes, observations of training/meetings, and documents. Data were first analyzed separately and then triangulated to investigate consistency in the findings. Data from the observations were analyzed at three different stages: (1) analysis done as an on-going process while reflecting on what was observed; (2) analysis after the study was completed; (3) analysis performed over the summer, after some time and at some distance from the study. AMIGOS provided volunteers with ideal opportunities to build a sense of civic and political engagement in youth. AMIGOS integrated key elements identified by current research: it provided opportunities for teaching about civic and political engagement, and provided opportunities for reflection. In addition, it incorporated real activities: students spent from six to eight weeks in a host community trying to effect positive change. Finally, their efforts were supported, recognized and praised by family members, the communities they come from, and the communities they were assisting. Spectrum also had the potential to build a sense of civic and political engagement in their members. However, they faced challenges that risked lessening their potential impact. The club engaged in "teaching" about civic and political and engagement and provided the members with opportunities to engage in real activities. However, they did not always receive the support and recognition of their communities (school) or families, and often faced opposition to achieving their goal of equal LGBT rights.

AB  - In 2007, the National Youth Leadership Council (NYLC) directed the field of service-learning by publishing the K-12 Service-Learning Standards for Quality Practice. These standards form an effective guide to serve-learning practice. The next step in service-learning research calls to “test the standards and indicators as predictors of outcomes” (Billig & Weah, 2008, p. 12) and more closely delineate the degree to which each identified standard impacts service-learning outcomes. This study more closely examined the indicators of meaningful service by answering the following research questions: 1) What is the level of meaningful service in different service-learning projects a. Does gender impact these perceptions? 2) How do different levels of meaningful service impact the student regarding: civic skills, civic engagement' self-efficacy, academic engagement, and academic grades a. Does gender impact these outcomes? 3) How do student outcomes regarding civic skills, civic engagement, self-efficacy, academic engagement, and academic grades, compare between two schools, with one providing service-learning and the other school not providing service-learning a. Does gender impact these differences? The study analyzed fifth through eighth grade students at two private schools in Southeastern Wisconsin, and researched the impact of lour different types of service-learning experiences on student civic skills, civic engagement, self-efficacy, academic engagement, and academic grades. Students rated the level of meaning they perceived in the service performed. Measures of meaning were correlated with student civic skills, civic engagement, self-efficacy, academic engagement, and academic grades. Correlations were measured using quantitative self-assessment and course grades. The study found that the projects scored statistically significant differences in their levels of meaning. Overall, student perceptions of project meaning highly correlated with students' civic skills (r=.49), civic engagement (r=.55), self-efficacy (r=.41), and academic engagement (r=.55). However, the degree of correlation between meaningful service and the score on outcomes differed based on the grade level project. When comparing all males with all females at the treatment site, gender differences were present, but those findings were not always supported when gender comparisons were disaggregated by grade level. Additionally, the measured outcomes differed minimally between the treatment school and the comparison school, but differences varied based on grade level.

AB  - This study was predicated on the null hypothesis that, “There is no difference in the self-esteem and attitudes toward school and community between high school students who are involved in school-sponsored service-learning experiences and those who are not involved in school-sponsored service-learning experiences.” The research design consisted of a pre-post questionnaire administered to high school students in the fall and spring of the 2000–2001 school year. The population of 95 ninth and tenth graders was made up of 46 students who had signed up for a service-learning program called Ambassadors and 49 students who had chosen not to participate in this program. This high school is located in a third tier suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota. The results of the study accepted the null hypothesis but further analysis revealed results that supported previous research into the positive effects of service-learning and raised some other issues and implications that merit further study. Though the self-esteem of the entire group increased from fall to spring there was no statistically significant change either as an entire group or between the service-learning group and the control group. However, the service-learning group did have an increase in self-esteem that was statistically significant and this corroborates other research results on service-learning. In addition, the researcher concluded that those students (regardless of group) who had previous, extensive volunteer, service, or community involvement scored higher on the instruments and showed modest gains while those with little or no previous experience scored lower and declined from the pre and post test. Conclusions and recommendations included providing longitudinal studies to follow these effects and more opportunities for younger students in school to experience service and service-learning to level the playing field so as to leave no child behind.

AB  - Research on youth civic engagement has emphasized the importance of growing up in a civic context. We examined the relative influence of neighborhood characteristics (neighborhood opportunities and intergenerational closure), civic education at school, friends' civic engagement, and parents' civic engagement on civic attitudes and civic behaviors among youths. Participants were 403 11- to 15-year-old adolescents randomly selected from the city register of a midsized city in Italy. The hierarchical regression analysis found that all analyzed contexts were related to adolescent civic engagement. In particular, intergenerational closure, friends' civic engagement, and parents' civic engagement were associated with both civic attitudes and civic behaviors. Findings highlighted the importance of considering multiple contexts to understand what factors are associated with youth civic engagement. We discuss ways that findings can be transmitted into further research and practice to address the multiple contexts in which youths are embedded and their relative influence on adolescent civic engagement.

AB  - This study investigated whether an after-school, service-learning intervention could increase belonging for Latino elementary school students who were attending a new school and who had previously attended at least two elementary schools. The intervention program derives from research demonstrating the negative academic and social ramifications of mobility, as well as the research indicating that increasing a student's belonging to his or her school can eradicate many of these consequences. Attachment to school may be especially important for Latino students. Service learning, an instructional practice in which students perform service that is planned by the students and is responsive to authentic community needs, is one promising method of increasing student belonging. This study involved designing and implementing a six-week after-school intervention program during which students completed a service project to benefit the school community. Using student surveys, student interviews, teacher interviews, teacher reflections and student journal reflections, I measured student feelings of belonging prior to the intervention as well as after. A non-participant group illustrated the transition experience for incoming students without an intervention. My findings demonstrate that students in the intervention program displayed increased classroom participation, increased self-confidence, increased numbers of friends, increased numbers of relationships with adults at school, and an increased general enjoyment of school. These findings were not true of the non-participant group. The findings also indicate that service learning may not have been as important to the students as was the community-building that occurred during the intervention program. Specifically, giving students ultimate control and decision-making power, as well as providing a shared experience and common goal, allowed the students to form a community within their new school.

AB  - It is increasingly important for students to develop practiced and applied knowledge, teamwork skills, and civic engagement in addition to core curriculum knowledge in order to be prepared for the demands of the 21st century workforce. We propose that service-learning, or learning through an applied community service project, can uniquely address these essential 21st century skills. Thus, in this paper, we outline a specific service-learning project geared towards improving these skill-sets. Then, we design an experiment to test the efficacy of this project in increasing these skills by comparing students who completed this project to those in a control condition. Results support study hypotheses that service-learning increases teamwork and civic engagement, and partially support the hypothesis that it increases practiced and applied knowledge. Additionally, students in the service-learning condition outperformed students in the control condition on a test of core-curriculum knowledge. Thus, this study supports the overall assertion that service-learning can be used to successfully teach students 21st century skills.

Five significant variables were unpaid school-year or summer internshps, service learning, volunteering, and other workplace experience. High unemployment in the state may have diminished some of STC's impact on dropout. (JOW)

As part of their science curriculum, the special needs students participated in beautification projects with senior citizens at an assisted living facility. Interviews, reflection exercises, and archival records were used to collect data. Findings included the participants' descriptions of what it means to care for others, their formation of positive relationships with seniors, their growing a sense of pride and confidence to become more actively engaged in the classroom. Participants also understood the responsibility to provide quality services to those in need. These findings seemed consistent with literature from previous service-learning research.

AB  - This paper examines educational environments that promote learning and explores the ways that such environments produce differentially positive results. It is based on a study that investigated the effects of a theoretically based social-constructivist approach to education, in contrast to the more classroom-based "abstract" instruction used in middle-school environments. Ten middle-school teachers participated in the study. The teachers met over the summer and designed service-learning projects in which they wanted to be involved and in which they thought students would be interested. The teachers reported that project-based instruction afforded an opportunity for students to succeed where they might not have in a traditional classroom. Teachers learned personal things about students, how students approached tasks, students' level of understanding, and students' existing knowledge about the content areas of the school curriculum. The results show that students who were involved in projects achieved higher gains in standardized test scores than did students in the control group, despite 20 percent less academic instructional time, suggesting that student involvement in projects during the school day enhanced their performance. Students who were already achieving at high levels also benefited from the project. (Contains two tables of data and four references.) (RJM)

AB  - Objectives. To determine if the Teen Outreach Program (TOP), a youth development and service learning program, can reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors compared with a business as usual or benign counterfactual. Methods. We synthesized results of 5 independent studies conducted in 5 geographically and ethnically diverse locations between 2011 and 2015 with 17 194 middle and high school students. Each study cluster-randomized classes, teachers, or schools to treatment or control groups and included the students enrolled in those clusters at baseline in an intent-to-treat analysis. Multilevel models tested impacts on recent sexual activity, recent unprotected sexual activity, and sexual initiation among the sexually inexperienced at baseline at approximately 1 and 2 years after baseline. Results. Precision-weighted average effect sizes showed nonsignificant reductions of 1 percentage point or less in recent sexual activity (5 studies: -0.6; P = .32), recent unprotected sex (5 studies: -0.2; P = .76), and sexual initiation (4 studies: -1.1; P = .10) after 1 year. Conclusions. There was little evidence of the effectiveness of TOP in reducing sexual risk-taking behaviors. Results underscored the importance of continually evaluating evidence-based programs that have previously been shown to be effective.

AB  - The effects of service-learning on social responsibility and academic success were investigated among a sample of 1,153 racially and socioeconomically diverse students in Grades 6 through 8 in three middle schools. Over the school year, service-learning students maintained their concern for others' social welfare, whereas control students declined on those concerns. Service-learning students, especially girls, also declined significantly less than did controls in their frequency of talking with parents about school. Compared with other students, students with substantial hours of service learning, a lot of reflection, and a high degree of motivation attributed to service-learning, significantly increased their belief in the efficacy of their helping behaviors, maintained their pursuit of better grades and their perception that school provided personal development opportunities, and decreased less in their commitment to classwork. The results indicate that service-learning can positively affect students' social responsibility and academic success. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Three large and diverse data sets were used to study the relations among 6th?12th grade students' community service and service-learning experiences, academic success, and socioeconomic status (SES). Principals in high-poverty, urban, and majority nonwhite schools were more likely to judge service-learning's impact on student attendance, engagement, and academic achievement as very positive. Students with higher levels of service/service-learning reported higher grades, attendance, and other academic success outcomes. Low-SES students with service/service-learning scored better on most academic success variables than their low-SES peers with less or no service or service-learning. Service-learning may be especially attractive to principals of low-SES schools, in part because it may be related to higher achievement generally and to smaller achievement gaps between higher- and lower-income students.

AB  - The National Household Education Survey, a nationally representative data set (N = 4,306 high school students and one parent of each), was analyzed to describe characteristics of adolescents, the nature of their service activities, and academic, behavioral and civic outcomes associated with service (voluntary compared to school-required and by type of service). Participation in any service is associated with positive outcomes whether service is voluntary or required. Adolescents who worked directly with individuals in need had better academic adjustment; those who worked for organizations had better civic outcomes than adolescents who performed other types of service. Findings are discussed in terms of their significance for adolescent development, educational policy, and the use of large national data sets to examine service participation.

AB  - This mixed methods case study describes an innovative two-semester middle school environmental learning course that departs from traditional Mexican expository pedagogy through the incorporation of experiential and service learning. This research takes place in a small middle school in Pescadero, Baja California Sur, Mexico. The research approach utilized in the study adds to the handful of studies in this cross-disciplinary field by employing quantitative methodologies to measure course outcomes on student environmental knowledge, perceptions, and actions, while simultaneously qualitatively describing the behavioral, educational, environmental, and social experiences of students. This research employs Dewey's theories of experience—as well as those of more contemporary authenticity theorists—in order to identify the philosophies that advocate incorporating experiential pedagogy within the curriculum. Implications for Mexican educational policy, practical pedagogical applications, and theory are discussed.

AB  - This study examined opportunities for high school students to become involved in higher levels of thinking through service-learning. Higher levels of thinking is defined as all cognitive indicators above the knowledge level in Bloom's taxonomy. Service-learning is defined as a curriculum approach to experiential learning. Two instruments were developed and administered to a sample of fifty suburban high school students. The Service-Learners' Self-Perceptive Inventory, measured students' frequency of involvement in higher levels of thinking. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were derived from the inventory. The Service-Learners' Directed Log assessed the quality of student performance involving higher levels of thinking. To analyze the data from this instrument regarding the issue of time spent on site and involvement in higher levels of thinking, a Kruskal-Wallis procedure was used. In addition, a Spearman Rho was calculated to look for potential correlations existing between the students' Differential Aptitude Test and the California Test of Mental Maturity and their higher level thinking score. Analysis of the data collected disclosed: (1) that both the service-learners' quality of performance score, and its self-perceptive score, showed its students were offered an opportunity to be involved in higher levels of thinking through participation in service-learning; (2) that the amount of time spent in Service-Learning did not promote higher levels of thinking; and, (3) that the all-school test scores (Differential Aptitude Test, California Test of Mental Maturity) did not correlate with the higher levels of thinking scores. In general, the data supported the contention that service-learning provides an opportunity for higher levels of thinking to take place. As a result, the researcher recommends that high school personnel consider service-learning as a potential instructional strategy for incorporating higher levels of thinking in teaching.

AB  - The purpose of Science in Action (SIA) was to examine the relationship between implementing quality science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) service-learning (SL) projects and the effect on students' academic engagement in middle school science, civic responsibility, and resilience to at-risk behaviors. The innovative project funded by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) included 6,000+ middle school at-risk students (eligible for at least 50% free or reduced-cost lunch), 126 science teachers who integrated STEM problem-based SL pedagogy into science instruction to teach students to solve real problems in schools and communities. The project involved 20 schools and communities with assistance from 120 community partners. Participants completed pre- and post-SL surveys on academic engagement, civic responsibility, and resilience; qualitative data were collected from journals, interviews, focus groups, observations, and field notes. Results highlight exemplary SL projects that demonstrated increased student academic engagement and achievement for students living in high poverty areas with potential at-risk behavior. Implications for future research and educational practices are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the development of leadership within a service-learning project in a middle school setting. Attention to developing leadership traits of students by providing an opportunity to work together to help others was the focus of the project. An action research approach was used involving surveys and interviews to gather data. Students were offered the opportunity to organize a major campaign within the community during their own time. Guidance was provided by some staff; however students seriously took the opportunity to lead. Five students were interviewed and asked to reveal their reactions to the project including areas they felt were successful, and suggestions to improve leadership opportunities. Students felt that they were successful in developing leadership skills in a number of areas and expressed a desire to develop these skills further.

AB  - The literature on service-learning outcomes in pre-adolescent children is relatively sparse. Empathy (i.e., overall, cognitive, affective) and community engagement (i.e., connection to the community, civic awareness, civic efficacy) were assessed in 155 first, second, and fifth graders (n = 79 males; n = 76 females) using a pre/post design for a five-session pilot service-learning program. Paired-samples t tests indicated positive changes in empathy and community engagement over time. Post-community engagement was examined by a mediation analysis of empathy (Time 2) on community engagement (Time 1). Additional analyses revealed an overall change in empathy and community engagement for all grades, but cognitive empathy increased only for fifth graders. Similarly, only fifth-grade participants showed a significant change in civic efficacy, pointing to a developmental factor for civic efficacy that should be examined more extensively. Future research and recommendations for studies of the impact of service-learning programs in primary and elementary school are discussed.

AB  - Background/Context: Sociopolitical development (SPD) refers to the processes by which an individual acquires the knowledge, skills, emotional faculties, and commitment to recognize and resist oppressive social forces. A growing body of scholarship has found that such sociopolitical capabilities are predictive in marginalized adolescents of a number of key outcomes, including resilience, academic achievement, and civic engagement. Many scholars have long argued that schools and educators have a central role to play in fostering the sociopolitical development of marginalized adolescents around issues of race and class inequality. Other scholars have investigated school-based practices for highlighting race and class inequality that include youth participatory-action research, critical literacy, and critical service-learning. Objective of Study: The present study sought to add to the existing scholarship on schools as opportunity structures for sociopolitical development. Specifically, this study considered the role of two different schooling models in fostering adolescents' ability to analyze, navigate, and challenge the social forces and institutions contributing to race and class inequality. Setting: The six high schools participating in the present study were all urban charter public high schools located in five northeastern cities. All six schools served primarily low-income youth of color and articulated explicit goals around fostering students' sociopolitical development. Three of these high schools were guided by progressive pedagogy and principles, and three were guided by no-excuses pedagogy and principles. Research Design: The present study compared the sociopolitical development of adolescents attending progressive and no-excuses charter high schools through a mixed methods research design involving pre-post surveys, qualitative interviews with participating adolescents and teachers, and ethnographic field notes collected during observations at participating schools. Results: On average, adolescents attending progressive high schools demonstrated more significant shifts in their ability to analyze the causes of racial inequality, but adolescents attending no-excuses high schools demonstrated more significant shifts in their sense of efficacy around navigating settings in which race and class inequality are prominent. Neither set of adolescents demonstrated significant shifts in their commitment to challenging the social forces or institutions contributing to race and class inequality. Conclusions: Both progressive and no-excuses schools sought to foster adolescents' commitment to challenging race and class inequality, but focused on different building blocks to do so. Further research is necessary to understand the pedagogy and practices that show promise in catalyzing adolescents' analytic and navigational abilities into a powerful commitment to collective social action-the ultimate goal of sociopolitical development.

AB  - National standards call for increased focus on meaningful teaching and learning that is developmentally appropriate and helps all students reach proficiency not only in basic skills but also in higher order thinking skills and real-world application of skills. Among recommendations for including real-world experiences into students' education is service-learning (SL). The paucity of research and mixed findings on academic outcomes from K-12 SL lead to an examination of opportunity-to-learn conditions and practices in 271 middle-level schools in 16 states involved in documenting school improvement to find out by whom and how SL was implemented. Although most teachers believed SL was essential to effective education, they used the strategies infrequently. Yet a group of teachers did use these strategies on a regular basis. SL was used more regularly by knowledgeable, experienced teachers with more professional knowledge of the national and state curriculum standards and the issues related to adolescent development. Questions for further research include the structural/organizational characteristics of the schools where the strategies of service-learning were used more frequently; the differences, if at all, in the school climate; and the types of decision-making opportunities available to these teachers. (Contains 7 tables of data, 2 figures, 3 endnotes, and 70 references.) (Author/BT)

AB  - The value of direct community engagement in learning concepts and in developing habits of sociologically informed observation and analysis are well documented in a growing body of literature. Here I present a service-learning approach to community engagement that has shown good results in encouraging student learning and firing enthusiasm. The course, Social Stratification, uses a variety of readings to introduce students to core concepts with an emphasis on wages, work, education and post-industrial economies, all topics of particular relevance in my mid-sized Midwestern city. The reading is paired with class visits to key area institutions and a flexible service learning project that allows students to connect their experience of "hard times" with a sociological foundation and a broader perspective on opportunities and struggles in the local community.

AB  - When Service Learning was first established in the Chicago Public Schools (GPS), its dual mission was to strengthen the classroom instruction of high school students in order to improve overall academic success, and to fulfill real needs in the city of Chicago. Since the beginning of the CPS Service Learning program in 1998, a vigorous effort involving more than eighty thousand (80,000) students has taken place, and has resulted in close to two million hours of volunteer service being provided to the city of Chicago. Over half of all public high school students have already participated in Service Learning projects, with a substantial expansion projected over the next few years. In this status report, please note that these dual missions--in just three short years--have met their targeted implementation timelines, and that the original concept continues to guide program growth and development.

AB  - The article highlights a lack of research-based school-to-work transition programs for learning-disabled students in general education classrooms and suggests service learning as a solution. Service learning is defined as linkage of academics to community-based, student-directed service projects. Various examples of successful service learning projects are given including a group of fourth-graders in Hudson, Massachusetts who conducted a year-long study of a local wetland, collecting samples and data and cleaning up the area. The group, consisting of low-income students, scored in the top 20 percent of the state high-stakes test. The article notes that service learning projects can often be used to meet goals of individualized education plans and can align with content-based standards.

AB  - This article describes an innovative lab course in which students designed and constructed five developmentally (and locally) appropriate museum exhibits around the theme ``Healthy Living.{''} They installed these at a local children's museum, designed a pretest/posttest to assess children's learning from the exhibit, conducted children through the exhibit and the assessment, analyzed the data, and wrote up their results: The exhibits were effective in increasing children's knowledge. A content analysis of essays by the student researchers, reflecting on what they had learned from the project, revealed learning at multiple levels, from content knowledge to increased self-understanding, perspective taking, and sense of efficacy, and further suggests that students would enjoy and strongly benefit from similar projects. Lessons and suggestions for future undertakings are offered.

AB  - This paper examines studies that have investigated academic learning outcomes in service learning, identifies unanswered questions in assessing academic efforts, and offers guidelines to evaluate content gains in courses that integrate service learning. Research shows that peer tutoring increases achievement scores for both the tutors and the students being tutored. Consistent gains in factual knowledge have been found when measuring the kind of information students are most likely to encounter in their field experiences. Studies show that community service is a valuable experience for helping students understand course material and achieve personal and educational goals. Some research shows that students involved in service learning get better grades and are more likely to feel that they have performed up to their potential in the course. Unanswered questions about service learning focus on: (1) why the assessment of academic learning outcomes in service learning is different; (2) what the methodological issues are that must be considered; and (3) what aspects of service learning have been most revealing. (Contains 30 references.) (SM)

AB  - Multifaceted, sustained efforts are needed to reduce early pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases among high-risk adolescents. An important area for research is testing youth development interventions offered through clinic settings, where access to high-risk adolescents is plentiful and few efforts have rigorously evaluated a dual approach of building protective factors while addressing risk. This article presents findings from a pilot study of Prime Time, a clinic-based youth development intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors among girls at risk for early pregnancy. Girls aged 13 to 17 years meeting specified risk criteria were assigned to Prime Time treatment groups. The Prime Time intervention included a combination of case management services and peer leadership groups. Participants completed self-report surveys at baseline, 12 and 18 months following enrollment. At 12 months, the intervention group reported significantly fewer sexual partners than the control group. At 18 months, the intervention group reported significantly more consistent condom use with trends toward more consistent hormonal and dual method use. Dose-response analyses suggested that relatively high levels of exposure to a youth development intervention were needed to change contraceptive use behaviors among adolescents at risk for early pregnancy. Given promising findings, further testing of the Prime Time intervention is warranted.

AB  - This preliminary study describes the transformation of students' racial attitudes and multicultural skills. A grounded theory approach was conducted to identify common themes from reflections of 19 students enrolled in a semester-long diversity service-learning course. The results indicate that students reformulate attitudes about racism and institutional discrimination through their own racial identity development from the beginning to the end of the semester. In addition, pre-test and posttest surveys were used to refine and expand the major themes about student attitudes and skills. The survey results indicate that students develop a greater interest in working with culturally diverse service recipients; acquire a deeper understanding of economic and educational conditions that impact the community; and gain multicultural awareness, knowledge, and skills by the end of the term. The combination of data from the quantitative and qualitative measures indicates that academic-based service learning (ABSL) is a useful pedagogy for teaching students multicultural skills.

AB  - Twenty–two students in a community action certificate program supplied “rising to the occasion” narratives during summer–long internships. They also filled out measures of generativity. Twenty–one students in an international studies certificate program that also included a summer internship served as a comparison group. Both groups reported equal personal growth from rising to the occasion experiences and no differences on measures of optimism, self–esteem or generativity. However, the community action students linked their personal growth experiences to future community service; a regression analysis also revealed that the best predictor of their stress–related growth was their level of generative concern. No comparable links emerged for the comparison group. Implications for cultivating connections between personal identity and civic responsibility through service–learning are discussed.

AB  - "Skills for Action," a program to build positive character values and life and citizenship skills for students in grades 9-12, includes classroom lessons and service learning. The program, with more than 100 lessons focused around 26 personal, social, and thinking skills, ranges from one semester to four years in length. Students explore personal stories highlighting values and behavior through teachers' questions and group discussion and resource pages in the curricular materials. For service learning, students perform school-based or community-based projects and reflect on their experiences. One study of "Skills for Action" met the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards with reservations. The study included almost 1,800 high school students in 26 classrooms from 25 rural, suburban, and urban schools in seven states in the eastern and central United States. The study authors examined results on students' knowledge, attitudes, and values. The WWC reviewed two studies on "Skills for Action"; one study met WWC evidence standards with reservations. It reported student outcomes in the knowledge, attitudes, and values domain. The study reported no statistically significant or substantively important findings. Therefore, the WWC rated the program as having no discernible effects on knowledge, attitudes, and values. Character education, an evolving field, is beginning to establish a research base.

AB  - Middle school teachers are accountable for helping young adolescents master a daunting number of basic skills and concepts. On the other hand, they are also expected to help their students develop a social conscience during what is arguably the most egocentric stage of their social development. This article presents a service learning project that focuses in not only testing students' knowledge of basic skills and concepts through authentic applications, but also requires them to demonstrate a social conscience. The project helps the teachers in Pine Point Middle School foster a sense of social and civic responsibility while providing "acceptable evidence" of student academic growth. The author also presents the benefits gained by the students in this project. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative and quantitative study was to understand the perspectives of so-called at-risk middle school students who participated in an alternative mid-level program and the support that program might have provided in their transition into high school. The study gives voice to such students and sheds light on the type of programs and practices that reduce their risk for dropping out of school. Dynarski and Gleason (2002) reported that early adolescence is a period of both enormous opportunity and enormous risk for dropping out of school. Participants were former students in the Swingshift Options School (SOS) program at Five Oaks Middle School in Beaverton, Oregon. Several methods of inquiry were used: interviews, surveys, and archival records. Together, these methods provided layers of meaning and were used to address the central question of the research: How did participation in the Five Oaks Swingshift Options School impact selected at-risk students' transition to and success in high school? This study looked at the history of middle schools and the research surrounding developmentally responsive middle schools. Additionally, the study situates the development of alternative programs relative to a critique of the concept of “at-riskness.” The findings indicate that the students in this study experienced difficulty in transitioning to high school, and the transition from middle to high school needs to be seamless for students at-risk for dropping out of school. The relationship with their teachers, counselors, and peers was very important to SOS students, and they valued smaller classes that helped them form positive relationships with their teachers. Flexible scheduling that allowed for access to service learning opportunities was also identified as a positive for the students while they were in middle school.

AB  - This study of high school students at the American School of Central America (ASCA) looks to evaluate the civic engagement program in the high school. The study looks to address two research questions: 1. What are the students’ knowledge, motivation, and organizational needs necessary for ASCA to achieve a minimum rate of one hundred and fifty civic engagement hours for all the graduates? 2. How civically engaged are ASCA students? What are the spaces and times that they are civically engaged? All high school students at ASCA were asked to participate in the study. Students completed a survey and selected students participated in an interview and supplied civic engagement reflections through their student ePortfolios. Students show knowledge and motivation to participate in civic engagement activities and the school provides students with some avenues to get involved in the community. Though students volunteer their time in the local community, the school can do more to promote sustainable civic engagement practices in its students and graduates. The study provides additional data and conclusions on civic engagement and focuses specifically on one private American school in Central America. The conclusions presented add to the literature on International/American schools and their ability to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to make lasting change in their communities.

AB  - As research today is often required to validate innovative aspects of education, David Sobel's analysis of the SEER report makes quantitative sense of nature education and its ability to improve learning. Test scores increase, attendance surges, language arts assessments show richer self-expression, speaking skills gain a community cause, math engagement flourishes, and students do science and not just study science. Environmental education combined with service learning takes the school into a higher purpose and creates rich learning incentives.

AB  - This report presents the findings of an evaluation of a three-year teacher enhancement project from the Social Science Education Consortium (SSEC). Under this project, middle school teachers were recruited and trained to develop and implement integrated science, social studies, and service-learning units in their classrooms. The project offered two cycles of four-week summer institutes for teacher teams from 12 school districts in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. The project also provided staff site visits and other assistance to teachers during the school year following each institute, and offered financial support for participants to attend a project meeting at the National Service Learning Conference held each spring. Using a standardized interview protocol, SSEC evaluators interviewed 55 teacher participants to determine the project's impact on participating teachers. The evaluators used interview responses to determine the effects of project participation on teachers' instruction, their collaboration with their colleagues and the community, and their beliefs about the impact of service learning projects on students' affective and academic learning. This report presents a summary and analysis of participant responses to the following categories of questions: (1) Participant Information; (2) Summer Institute; (3) Unit Implementation; (4) Team Experience and Dynamics; (5) Administrative Support; (6) Personal Impressions; (7) Future Expansion and Workshop; and (8) SSEC Relations and Follow-up. Conclusions and recommendations for future service learning projects are offered. (Author/WRM)

AB  - Service-learning is a classroom-based pedagogy that combines curricular goals with community service to facilitate reciprocal benefit. It works best when there is adequate preparation, student voice in designing projects, systematic formative and summative reflection, and is mentored by well-trained and impassioned faculty. As student service in the community is implemented in diverse ways, this study uses “community service/service-learning” to designate such service. It investigated how 375 graduating eighth graders in eight modern Orthodox middle schools (four high-use and four low-use) viewed their service in relation to the following: civic attitudes (regarding the intrinsic value of civic engagement and other community members), civic skills (critical thinking, leadership), connection with political processes, gender, school subject preference, overarching goals (philanthropic in the here and now and/or promoting political or social change), preferred terminology to designate service, and the extent to which service emanated from and involved the students in Jewish and/or American values and venues. Results indicated that students in both high-use and low-use schools expressed agreement that their service enhanced their civic attitudes, with students in high-use schools that allowed students greater voice in choosing their projects and females achieving higher scores in several variables. Favored school subject had no impact. The results were similar with regard to civic skills but here gender had no impact. With regard to the 2 subcategory of political process, the scores were lower in general, with students in high-use schools that allowed greater student voice achieving higher scores in several variables. Neither gender nor favored school subject had impact. Furthermore, service was more directly related to ethical behavior than to action designed to bring about systemic political or social change. Use of the Hebrew word chesed far exceeded the use of civic-based terminology in English. Students indicated Jewish identity as having far greater impact than American identity and their facts on the ground experience reflected greater involvement in the Jewish than the non-Jewish world. These results suggest a strong commitment to chesed in the schools studied, but question whether more can be done to connect student service to American civic life designed to promote political/social change.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of my study was twofold: (a) to examine the relationship between participation in Service-Learning in high school and civic engagement after graduation and (b) to examine whether specific components of a high-school Service-Learning program appear to influence whether a graduate will continue to serve in some capacity after graduation. Method. My study surveyed 89 individuals who graduated from six high schools between 1995 and 2003 to determine their current level of civic engagement in the areas of community service, advocacy, and political action. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to examine the impact of participating in service activities in high school on the development of civic character. Results. The results of my study indicated that student participation in high school service activities was likely to influence civic engagement as an adult. The area of advocacy had the largest effect size when comparing students who participated in high school service activities to those who did not. The area of political action had the smallest effect size and appeared to be the least influenced by service activities in high school. Schools in which service was integrated throughout the curriculum and student designed service projects were encouraged and supported appeared to have the greatest impact on the development of civic character.

AB  - This empirical research project investigated the nature of service-learning outcomes in two studies. Service-learning can be defined as the "service to the community and academic learning" (Eyler & Giles, 1999). Given the lack of empirical information on the topic, this study explored the relationship between various factors in a service-learning experience and service-learning outcomes. The first study analyzed outcomes of Education students (n = 123) in a total of twelve sections of a service-learning class (EDTE 400). The goal of this evaluation study was to determine if social and emotional learning (SEL) outcomes occurred in students participating in a service-learning project. The second study used an intervention in a comparative research design (additional reflective or didactic activity) with Psychology students (n = 23) participating in an after school program for emotionally and academically challenged middle school students. The goal of this small pilot intervention study was to investigate the influence of reflection on student outcomes. For both studies, a third hypothesis was also tested to see whether more reflective students had greater outcome gains than less reflective students. Results from the studies indicate that students do seem to gain SEL outcomes after participating in a service-learning experience. Different amounts of reflection, when encouraged by different intervention activities, did not seem to create differential service-learning growth outcomes. However, additional possible connections between reflection and outcomes emerged that warrant future study. Findings suggest that different types of reflection might be linked to different service-learning experiences and outcomes. These results helped to detail the type of relationship that exists between reflection occurring during a service-learning experience and service-learning outcomes.

AB  - In the spring of 2008, 1,847 principals of K-12 public schools, nationwide, responded to a survey on the prevalence of community service and service-learning in their schools. The "National Study of the Prevalence of Community Service and Service-Learning in K-12 Public Schools," sponsored by the Corporation for National and Community Service and conducted by Westat, collected data on the scope of community service and service-learning activities, as well as the policies and supports for service-learning provided by and for schools during the 2007-08 academic year. The survey utilized the same methodology as surveys of community service and service-learning conducted in 1999 and 2004, thereby allowing for a look at the trends in school-based community service and service-learning over the past decade. The study indicates that schools in low-income areas have not seen the same level of decline in service-learning that has occurred in schools that are not in low-income areas. As other research supports, this finding suggests that teachers and administrators of schools with a high proportion of students from low-income families are more likely to see the academic and civic benefits of service-learning. At a time when individuals see the civic and academic gap between youth from disadvantaged circumstances and those who are not growing, this is a positive sign that service-learning can help address this gap. The authors recommend that further research be conducted, not just with those civic-minded schools that support both community service and service-learning, but also with schools that report that they lack the time and the funds to incorporate service-learning into their classrooms. By better understanding both these groups, it will be possible to be responsive to the goals of schools to see their students succeed. Appendixes include: (1) Characteristics of Schools that Recognize Student Participation in Community Service and Arrange Community Service Opportunities for Students, 1999 and 2008, and (2) Characteristics of Schools with Service-Learning, 1999 and 2008.

AB  - This study, conducted in a Business/Technology course in a large public high school in Southeastern USA, Fall Semester, 2014, supports the use of Service-Learning in the schools for empowering students to serve the public good. Ninety-two students created classroom "DREAM TEAMS" for researching and seeking solutions for selected community problems presented in the DREAM OF A NATION text and media resources. Substantiated conclusions drawn from the collected student and teacher data indicate that students who actively participated in the Service Learning projects increased academically in technical skill proficiencies as well as in those basic social-emotional skills (empathy, compassion, and caring) and democratic worldviews that foster respect for people of all races and cultures.

AB  - What comes to mind when the word learning is mentioned? Is it a classroom full of students and a teacher dictating notes as the students struggle emphatically to write down every word that is said? Is it a picture of a student in the library with a stack of books piled on a desk, trying to read them all? These examples of learning may fit the traditional definition but this paper expands learning to include service. This paper describes a non-traditional style of learning that takes the student 'out of the comfort zone of the classroom' into the community and explains how this experience has an impact on the students' education as well as their lives. The authors of this paper hope to influence its readers to re-think the definition of learning by understanding the importance of service.

Students completed community service activities as part of their social sciencebased community service-learning course. These students were then compared to students in humanities and science courses who did not complete the civic education component. Findings suggested that a statistically significant difference existed in the social dominance orientation (SDO) between the students who participated in service-learning and the students who did not.

AB  - The ability to provide students with authentic learning opportunities in secondary education is diminishing due to the emphasis on standardized testing. However, the use of service learning in classrooms has been demonstrated through a variety of qualitative studies to provide enriched learning environments for students on multiple occasions. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrating the effects of service learning in one classroom for a single unit on the topic of economics. The results of this study revealed that students involved in the service-learning project gained as much economic literacy as the control group while also gaining 21st century skills such as teamwork, time management, project management, and communication.

AB  - The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to gather data on middle school students' perceptions of including democratic practices in an environmental service-learning project. The study explored students' perceptions of their inclusion in helping plan curriculum and student participation in civic engagement. Seventh grade students' perceptions of the personal benefits gained due to their participation in the environmental service-learning project were explored. Additionally, the study investigated students' perceptions of benefits to the local community due to students' participation in the project. Utilizing democratic practices in the classroom plays a critical role in supporting a democratic education; therefore, students were provided with the opportunity to be engaged in two democratic practices in a classroom project that also used curriculum integration in an environmentally-based situation. This study was based on the ideas underpinning democratic education and the work of Dewey and Beane as well as curriculum integration and the work of Apple and Beane, Drake, Fogarty, Hayes-Jacobs, and Pate, Homestead and McGinnis. This study focused on utilizing environmental education and service-learning as a vehicle for executing an integrated curriculum that fosters a democratic education.

AB  - The article presents a study on the influence of student-service and instructional expenditures among students. It states that institution-level data was used to sample each student's level of instructional and non-instructional expenditures. The results show that both student-service and instructional expenditures influence persistence and graduation rates and that student-service expenditures' significance varies throughout the academic institutions. It also mentions that students who were benefited by student-service expenditures are those who have low academic and economic performance.

AB  - Baseline survey was used to assess the reliabilities of the 12-item SLSEPDI and the nine-item SLBI scales, and posttest survey assessed the 10-item OVSL-SEPDI scale. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit index and all items loaded significantly on both the SL-SEPDI (χ2/df = 1.34; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .067; Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = .92; comparative fit index [CFI] = .94; incremental fit index [IFI] = .94; goodness-of-fit index [GFI] = .86) and SLBI (χ2/df = 1.28; RMSEA = .061; TLI = .97; CFI = .98; IFI = .98; GFI = .91) scales. Data also showed satisfactory reliability scores, with Cronbach's alphas of .87, .88, and .91 for the SL-SEPDI, SLBI, and OVSL-SEPDI scales. This study provides data supporting the validities and reliabilities of this service-learning measurement suite, and has implications to assess student self-efficacy outcomes.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) programs that include service-learning components have great potential to positively impact East African youth, their communities, and their ecology. This exploratory study describes 2 programs in East Africa, The Jane Goodall Institute's Roots & Shoots (R&S) and Wildlife Clubs of Uganda (WCU). The authors studied school-based programs in 10 communities adjacent to national parks or wildlife sanctuaries by interviewing and surveying student members, teachers, and program coordinators. Results indicate that despite the harsh context and unique challenges facing programs in the developing countries of Tanzania and Uganda, groups showed remarkable strides in increasing conservation knowledge, fostering members' personal and social development, and raising community awareness. The successes and challenges of these East African programs highlight the importance of considering contextual factors when designing best practices in conservation education.

AB  - Our study examined the relationship of creativity self-efficacy and emotions of high school students (n = 279) in Singapore before and after they attended a three to five-day international service learning program. Participants completed a creativity self efficacy scale, the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). We found a positive, significant correlation between creativity efficacy and positive affect, life satisfaction and subjective happiness but negative correlation with negative mood affect. In addition, students whose creativity efficacy was moderately high were found to have reported higher ratings of life satisfaction after having participated in service learning. Our findings provide initial evidence suggesting that service learning with positive intervention is positively related to creativity self-efficacy and happiness of youth.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the academic performance, social behavior, and attitude indices of fourth through sixth grade students participating in the Dare to Dream service-learning program to students enrolled in the same after-school program but not participating in Dare to Dream at four elementary schools in Fresno County. The study also analyzed program curriculum and implementation to determine whether or not Dare to Dream incorporated best practices in service-learning. Analysis was based on several sources. Information contained in an after-school program database was utilized as well as information contained in The Dare to Dream Violence Prevention Program Handbook, and interviews with Dare to Dream program directors. Results indicated that the Dare to Dream program did positively impact the academic performance, social behavior, and attitudes of the students in the program and that students in Dare to Dream improved more than students in the comparison group. Academically, students in Dare to Dream had significant improvements in their overall student grade point averages. Dare to Dream students were also more likely to have improved conduct grades and were less likely to be suspended after having participated in the program. Analysis of student and teacher surveys indicated change in student attitudes in some areas as a result of participation in the program. An analysis of the Dare to Dream curriculum indicates that the program did include most of the elements of best practices in service-learning; however, student training, strong linkage with community organizations, and a formal assessment mechanism were not evident.

AB  - Educators continually seek effective strategies to address the educational needs of students. Two popular strategies are service-learning and after-school programs. The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the value of embedding service-learning into after-school programs. This study utilized a historical database and compared two groups of students participating in an after-school program at four elementary schools. Preliminary results suggested that students participating in the service-learning component of the after-school program had greater improvement in their grade point averages and conduct grades and were less likely to be suspended than students who did not participate in the service-learning component.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of teachers, team members, and students as to the effectiveness of a service-learning program connecting to the curriculum. This mixed method study focused on perceptions of how the program at this school was conducted, the design and evaluation methods used and how these three groups perceived the program as an effective tool to connecting to the curriculum. The participants in this study were teachers, Leadership team members and 5th grade students at a small, rural elementary school. A self-assessment survey was distributed to 37 teachers and an age appropriate survey was distributed to 105 students. These instruments were useful in determining their perceptions of the program. Interviews were conducted with team members and 5th grade teachers. Data from these sources were triangulated to show comparisons in perceptions between the three groups. Analysis of the data showed differences in the perceptions of the three groups. The qualitative data provided information for opportunities to improve the school's program. Quantitative data from Section III Policy and Parameters and Section IV Practice and Pedagogy, in the teacher survey had significant results comparatively. This suggests that the organization of the program had an impact on the perceptions of the participants, which would be consistent with prior research on service-learning effectiveness. As a result of these findings, it is recommended that additional training be offered in the school and state standards be designed for elementary level schools.

AB  - This exploratory study assesses factors related to leadership development for African American adolescents participating in a community service program designed to develop young African American leaders (N = 345). Psychometric characteristics of self-reported levels of leadership are explored to determine similarities and differences between gender groups. A multivariate analysis of socioeconomic factors, levels of self-esteem, school grades, and social activities as predictors of leadership development produced mixed findings. The results suggest that higher levels of global and academic self-esteem are related to leadership characteristics in female respondents, but not males. On the other hand, the impact of program participation on leadership was only significant in the area of personal relationship skills as a form of leadership for males. Findings from this investigation point out the need for research on leadership development dynamics among African American children and adolescents. doi: 10.1300/J137v15n02_06 [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER] Copyright of Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Despite recognition that youth civic engagement is multidimensional, different modeling approaches are rarely compared or tested for measurement invariance. Using a diverse sample of 2,467 elementary, middle, and high school-aged youth, we measured eight dimensions of civic engagement: social responsibility values, informal helping, political beliefs, civic skills, environmental behavior, volunteering, voting intentions, and news consumption. We compared correlated unidimensional factors, higher-order factor, and bifactor models and tested for measurement invariance and latent mean differences by age. The correlated unidimensional factors model best fit the data, yet higher-order and bifactor models fit adequately. Metric and scalar invariance was found across models. Latent means varied depending on the dimension of civic engagement and the multidimensional model examined. Findings favored the correlated unidimensional factors model; implications of each model are discussed. This study informs future research on youth civic engagement and has broad relevance for any developmental scientist studying a multidimensional construct.

AB  - This research was aimed to develop multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab at the community under the bridge zone 1, to determine the quality of the multimedia and activities, to examine the learning achievement of the community youths, to evaluate the satisfaction of the sampling group and to evaluate the after-action review (AAR) of the organizers. The research tools in this study included the quality evaluation form for contents, the quality evaluation form for media and activities, the learning achievement test, the satisfaction survey for the sampling group towards the multimedia and activities, and the activity to get after-action review (AAR) of the organizers. The sampling group consisted of people who had lived in the community under the bridge zone 1 for over 2 years had participated in this research from the beginning till the end. There were 120 people who filled out the questionnaires. They were chosen using purposive sampling method. The group included local people and community youths. The research results showed that the organizers ran the project about dancing performance alongside single-head drums for the community youths through social lab. The multimedia included vinyl media and video clips to teach dancing performance alongside music from single-head drums. The clips and teaching were made by students who got scholarship from KMUTT for their art and cultural skills and the fence-painting activity was done by graduate students from the LTM652 Principle and Theories of Mass Communication course. The organizers analyzed, designed and developed multimedia and activities in accordance with the ADDIE Model in the first semester of the academic year 2018. The quality of the contents was at a good level (x-bar = 4.46, S.D = 0.26). The quality of the media and activities was at a very good level (x-bar = 4.60, S.D = 0.26). The learning achievement of the students from their pre-test and post-test scores showed that their average post-test score was higher with statistical significance at the 0.05 level. The satisfaction of the sampling group was at the highest level (x-bar = 4.63, S.D = 0.56), confirming the research hypothesis. The after-action review showed that it was at a good level. The organizers expressed their opinion that the multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab were beneficial for both the organizers and the community youths. The organizers learned how to work as a team and they could use their skills in real situations. They realized the importance of giving, especially teaching knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths. The community youths learned to spend their free time on useful activities and did not involve in drug abuse. They also learned new skills and they could do dancing performance to earn their living on the weekends and holidays or when there were festive events. It could be concluded that the multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab were of good quality and could be applied for real use.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a service-learning program on the development of civic attitudes and behaviors of 230 high school students who were identified as academically gifted and participated in either a service-learning program or an accelerated academic program during the summer. Students' responses to 3 surveys measuring civic responsibility, civic behavior, and leadership skills showed that enhanced civic responsibility, particularly a greater awareness of civic issues and a stronger connection and commitment to the community, was found among the students who participated in the service-learning program. Significant differences were not found for civic behaviors and leadership skills as a result of participation in the service-learning program. Longer term studies with students and examination of the type of service-learning activities students choose to get involved in are suggested to corroborate the positive outcomes of the service-learning program.

AB  - This research investigates the factors conducive to the success of young people growing up in low-income families. Many studies carried out locally and overseas focus on the risks and difficulties experienced by these young people; however, little attempt has been made to examine the factors that help them change their lives from failure, poverty, and social exclusion. Based on a quantitative survey of 405 young people recruited from schools and integrated youth service centers in Hong Kong, this research identifies a range of indicators of, and necessary conditions for, the positive development of young people with economic disadvantage. It also evaluates the way in which the functions of service participation, friendship networks, and various family factors support them to thrive in different areas. The study helps fill the gap of the existing literature and draws implications for policy and practice to address the needs of these youths. Future directions of research are also discussed.

AB  - The Hartford Project (THP) is a four-day Christian youth service-learning urban-immersion experience for middle and high school youth. A total of 277 youth and 71 adult leaders, from 21 church youth groups, participated in this program evaluation of THP. Findings from this study indicate that participation in THP resulted in increased civic engagement, greater leadership confidence, a more positive view of the city of Hartford, increased sense of responsibility to help those in need, and increased comfort interacting with people from different cultures and ethnicities for participating youth. Further, THP participation positively influenced adult leaders' views of the city of Hartford. Findings from this program evaluation suggest that service-learning experiences can facilitate spiritual and personal growth, both in youth and adult leaders.

AB  - This meta-analysis assessed the effect of community service on adolescent development and the moderation of this effect by reflection, community service, and adolescent characteristics to explicate the mechanisms underlying community service effects. Random effects analyses, based on 49 studies (24,477 participants, 12-20 years old), revealed that community service had positive effects on academic, personal, social, and civic outcomes. Moderation analyses indicated that reflection was essential; the effect for studies that include reflection was substantial (mean ES = .41) while community service in the absence of reflection yielded negligible benefits (mean ES = .05). Effects increased when studies include more frequent reflection and community service, reflection on academic content, and older adolescents. These findings have implications for understanding and improving community service.

AB  - Service-Learning (SL) has been defined as an experiential teaching methodology Through SL, students participate in activities that benefit their community and enhance their learning experience. In the current study, Spanish as a second language (L2) and heritage language learners (HLLs) engaged in a SL project in which they translated English language zoo signage into Spanish. The objectives of this investigation were to determine whether SL mediates lexical knowledge, and to what extent learners' linguistic background affects that knowledge. Participants included ten L2 learners and ten HLLs that translated signage in mixed dyads. A pre-test, a post-test, and a delayed post-test of target words were administered and analyzed via a paired sample t-test. Results indicate that vocabulary learning occurred as a result of the project. A qualitative analysis of learner reflections demonstrated the intricacies of learning. For instance, all learners gained an understanding of synonymic relations between low and high frequency words. With regard to HLLs, all four pedagogical goals outlined for heritage language pedagogy were met through the project, including language maintenance. The study concludes with pedagogical implications for the implementation of SL in the language classroom.

AB  - The last 6 decades of empirical research on civic engagement among young people living in democracies and of the recognition of international human rights have seen the achievement of many milestones. This article focuses on some connections between these 2 areas and examines the ways in which everyday settings such as neighborhoods and the schools that exist within them can foster support for human rights (especially the practice of participatory rights) among adolescents. Secondary analysis of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement Civic Education (CIVED) Study (data collected in 1999 from nationally representative samples of 14-year-olds in 28 countries) is presented. A cluster analysis of 12 attitudinal scales in 5 countries sharing the Western European tradition (Australia, England, Finland, Sweden, and the United States) is presented. A new conceptual model is also introduced, a modification of Super and Harkness's Developmental Niche. This model frames an analysis unpacking some findings from the CIVED Study and focusing on the everyday experiences and neighborhood niches for the development of participatory human rights. The larger message is that research on social justice attitudes among young people is a valuable form of social advocacy and action.

AB  - This thesis provides an empirical analysis of the impact service-learning has on high school dropout rates. Specifically, it examines whether school districts that receive Learn and Serve America grants to support service-learning have statistically different high school dropout rates than do districts that do not. The paper is based on the hypothesis that districts that receive grants have lower dropout rates than do socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically comparable school districts that do not. The relationship between service-learning and high school dropout rate was examined through ordinary least squares regression to assess whether there was a statistically significant relationship between the two variables and whether this relationship remains robust across all three models employed. Data from both the California Department of Education and Learn and Serve America were utilized in the ordinary least squares regression analysis. The analyses revealed that districts receiving grants for service-learning programs, on average, had lower district-wide dropout rates. However, the difference between grant recipients and non-recipients was not statistically significant. Similar to previous research, my analysis revealed that districts with larger proportions of minority students and federal free and reduced lunch recipients, on average, had higher district-wide dropout rates than did comparable districts with lower proportions of students with these characteristics. Conversely, districts with higher percentages of students scoring proficient or above on English Language Arts (ELA) exams had lower dropout rates, on average. Based on this research, dropout prevention efforts ought to continue to focus on minority and low income students. Special attention should be placed on the acquisition of ELA skills. Additionally, due to the negative relationship between the serving-learning and dropout rate variables, districts ought to consider incorporating service-learning programs into curriculum. However, future research that controls for the quality of the service-learning programs and the caliber of the district leadership is needed to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the dropout rates of districts that provide service-learning, through Learn and Serve America grants, and those that do not.

AB  - Reviews literature concerning participants, practices, and outcomes related to service-learning. Factors influencing service-learning include student group composition, and faculty experiences and views concerning service-learning projects. Likely different service-learning practices, including duration and time commitment, are better suited to some types of students than others. The use of student reports in rating service-learning projects poses several problems, including the effects of demographic characteristics on self-ratings. Many studies have reported that service-learning promotes personal growth, but not all studies are in agreement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This empirical paper argues that intermediate dyslexic learners' literacy skills can be enhanced through a community-based service learning project. Hence, this research is grounded and positioned within Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory and the theories of experiential education, as described by Dewey and Kolb. In collaboration with eight postgraduate students in support teaching, this study developed a literacy intervention programme for intermediate dyslexic learners and implemented this programme for a period of nine months, at a special school for learning-impaired learners in the Free State province of South Africa. The literacy intervention programme was based on Ron Davis' learning strategies, ie a multi-sensory programme focusing on visual, kinaesthetic and cognitive development strategies by using dyslexic learners' creativity. It was hypothesised that the reading and spelling performance of intermediate dyslexic learners in the experimental group (N=18) would be significantly better than that of intermediate dyslexic learners in the control group (N=18) who were not exposed to the literacy intervention programme. Positive outcome goals of this community-based service learning project included the development of positive attitudes towards community engagement, students realising their social responsibility, the gaining of insights into and understanding of social and educational issues, and finally the opportunity to develop lifelong learning and problem-solving skills.

AB  - This outline of a presentation describes a resource curriculum kit for involving youth in Special Olympics. The kit being described contains a fully scripted, four-lesson curriculum unit for grade levels K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12. The themes of the four lessons are awareness (e.g., avoiding stereotypes and increasing knowledge); understanding (e.g., what it is like to have a cognitive disability); inspiration (e.g., why Special Olympics athletes succeed at what they do); and action (e.g., making connections in the school and community with Special Olympics). The kit offers tools for involving children and youth with and without mental retardation in Special Olympics. The curriculum helps schools and teachers meet a variety of requirements and needs such as academic achievement standards, understanding and acceptance of individual differences, and youth development and character education. It involves service learning projects in the school and community, and it promotes and supports physical activity, physical fitness, and sports participation. At the elementary and middle school levels, lessons fit into the activities of social studies, language arts, history, and other core curriculum programs. At the high school level, lessons fit into activities of the physical education program. (SM)

AB  - At the 2006 National Association of Gifted Children Conference, a panel presentation addressed the importance of providing gifted children with opportunities to take positive social action through service-learning; this article is a result of that discussion. The Future Problem Solving Program (among others) has a community problem-solving component to help instill the habits of responding to community needs in socially constructive ways. A service-learning project conducted by secondary gifted students is discussed. The highest level of service-learning is an effective curriculum for gifted students that exposes them to community problems and encourages them to solve those problems creatively. Through service-learning, gifted youth have opportunities to expand their global awareness, practice skills of positive action, and make real their vision of a better future.

AB  - This case study used a student voice program in an urban middle school in the southeastern United States to examine the validity of three theoretically derived pathways through which student voice may affect positive school climate. First, using a youth participatory action research process to identify barriers to learning, analyse their root causes, and advocate for solutions to school administration allowed students to influence minor school policies and implement anti-bullying, classroom-behaviour-monitoring, and experiential-learning initiatives. However, there were challenges to making these policy and practice changes systemic. Second, relationships were formed and strengthened as a byproduct of student participant and staff collaboration in program activities. However, the program may have contributed to an ingroup-outgroup dynamic between participants and other peers. Third, students who participated in the program developed citizenship competencies, and their development may have promoted broader prosocial norms among the student body, though evidence was inconsistent. Study findings suggest that future research examine how variations in the implementation of student voice initiatives can maximize the contribution to a positive school climate in urban schools. Findings also suggest that practitioners should ensure that student teams be representative of a multitude of student identities. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

AB  - Pre- and post-test measures of students engaged in a service-learning intervention as well as focus group discussions were compiled. The measures included scores on the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale, the Adult State Hope Scale, the Quality of School Life Scale (the Reactions to Teachers and the Satisfaction with School subscales only), and the Community Service Self-Efficacy Scale. In addition to the pre-and post-test survey measures for the student participants (n = 42) involved with the service-learning interventions, findings related to 8 focus groups involving former students who graduated (n = 18), educational staff supporting the interventions (n = 13), and field supervisors at the service-learning sites (n = 11) were included in the data set. The findings indicated that there are many positive benefits associated with the in-service intervention for students who were at-risk of dropping out of school. These findings were demonstrated through statistically significant changes in a number of perceptions associated with the positive outcome measures of hope, attitudes towards school, and community service self-efficacy. Former students provided credence to the changes they experienced. They reported positive long-lasting effects related to their service-learning experiences that were maintained in their lives and work histories after high school. For many, service-learning experiences served as an orientation to careers related to social service. Educational staff reported observing multiple benefits associated with the developmental progression of the students who participated in the service-learning intervention experiences. Field supervisors, however, reported more negative views and many of them stated that they were skeptical about the long-lasting benefits associated with service-learning interventions. The findings from this study indicated that beneficial changes could occur as a result of enhanced inclusion of field supervisors in the intervention. In addition, academic ties to students' reflections during the course of their service-learning experiences are likely to be beneficial. In sum, the findings indicate that service-learning interventions hold considerable promise to bring about positive changes among students who at-risk of dropping out of high school.

AB  - This article describes a service-learning intervention, the CivicConnections Program, as implemented by 96 teachers in 32 site-based teams in 21 states during 2004-2005. Each of the 32 teams was responsible for multiple service-based, social studies classrooms serving a total of more than 2500 students in grades 3-12. The individual classroom-level projects demonstrated much diversity. Student responses to pre-surveys and retrospective pre- and post-surveys indicated consistent and important growth regardless of ethnic background or grade level. Students reported significant increases in their knowledge and sense of efficacy and participation. The magnitude of reported outcomes differed considerably depending on the site where students participated, even though all 32 sites demonstrated some significant growth on the retrospective pre- to post-survey comparisons.

AB  - What is service-learning and how can students and community benefit from it? With the pressure of covering all of the content, passing tests, meeting standards and making AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress), how is it realistically feasible to make learning more meaningful so that students are able to take it and utilize it in real life? There is no panacea, however, one way to help support students in this is through service-learning. The goal of service-learning is to logically connect the curriculum to a service activity where students are actively engaged in a complex and meaningful project. In turn, this project involvement demands that they take the content information and apply it to a real-life problem and/or issue. Research has found that benefits from service-learning include: (1) improvement in grades; (2) higher attendance rates; (3) lowers drop-out rates; (4) development of personal and social responsibility; (5) builds positive and collaborative relationships between students and teachers and students and the community; (6) reverses student disengagement; (7) provides more motivation for learning; (8) develops a sense of civic and democratic awareness and responsibility; (9) fewer behavior problems; (10) exposure to different careers; and (11) crosses cultural and class barriers. Studies also found that students with higher GPAs were more likely to participate in school-service programs than those with lower ones; students in private schools were more likely to contribute time to service than those in public schools; and those who participated in service programs and came from low SES backgrounds, tended to make higher grades and had smaller achievement gaps than their non-participating peers.

AB  - This paper explores the ways one school continues to enhance both literacy and service-learning through the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. Over the course of their middle-school years, young adolescents at Canterbury School visit a range of sites in the community. They also explore service-learning at home and around the world by linking service-learning explicitly to academic tasks. An experiential learning unit in seventh grade allows students to understand global issues and challenges from participants' perspectives. They then bring these perspectives to bear in service-learning and in writing assignments in the eighth-grade year. (Contains 3 resources and 2 online resources.)

AB  - Fair Battles is a 12-week Swiss education for social justice program with the goal of sensitizing high school students about the impact of their consumer habits on society. The pedagogical concept of Fair Battles is to employ the tool of serious play to enhance students' social empathy, which then leads to service learning projects. This exploratory mixed-methods study examined the impact of the program by using pre- and post-program student surveys (n = 16) and post program semi-structured qualitative student interviews (n = 10). The survey data were analyzed using SPSS and the interview data were analyzed using template analysis. The results were organized according to Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model. The quantitative results show a statistically significant increase in the post-program survey scores for the learning and behavior level. The qualitative results suggest that the program had a positive impact on students on all four of Kirkpatrick's levels. The conclusions are that the Fair Battels program is impactful, that social justice education needs to be holistic and that the combination of serious play and service learning elements seems to be effective for social justice education. Further research in the area of social justice education and serious play is recommended.

AB  - The Twenty-First Century Community Learning Center (CCLC) grant is the only federally funded grant for after-school programs. The grant allows communities to establish community-based after-school programs based on various community risk indicators with the goal of minimizing the risk. This study examined academic differences among students who attended Twenty-First CCLC after-school programs frequently (30 days or more) and similar non-participants during the 2013-2014 school year. Schools included in this study are those located in the northern region of the state of Louisiana where poverty is high and school performance scores have traditionally been below the state average for English/language arts. Paired t-tests were used to determine the significant differences between mean scores of attendance at 0-60 and 61 or more days. Students in District A had significantly higher scores based on attendance. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine if attendance impact participants' growth. Significant growth was identified in District A by grade three students by grade three and seven students in District B. More research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of after school tutoring programs using longitudinal data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper offers a study of a Saturday science-activity club for young secondary school aged girls, in Cardiff, UK. It provides a critical analysis of interactions between group participants and their mentors in building an equitable and experiential learning zone for the promotion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as subject and occupational choices. This study explores how science outreach programmes for young women represent a form of gender re-education, reconfiguring and redefining gender identities in science. We consider how an informal, experiential learning programme scaffolds female learners in discovering the confidence to negotiate multiple iterations of STEM, and in developing an ability to celebrate gender difference and the multiple roles of women to science.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the reflection component of service-learning and upper elementary students’ perceptions of self-efficacy and collective efficacy. The central research question was: What is the service-learning model that explains the greatest variance between student perceptions of self and collective efficacy and modes of reflective practice, while controlling for the total number of hours spent on the service-learning experience, hours spent with the beneficiaries of the service, and the level of service-learning experience implementation of the teacher? This key research question was complimented by sub-questions that provided insight into the influence of grade-level, modes, frequency and context of reflection on student perceptions of self and collective efficacy. The study employed the methodology of survey research, including techniques of quantitative pre-post and post ex-facto survey design to generate data relevant to the research questions. Findings indicated that the constructs of self and collective efficacy take time to develop, and grade level may have an influence on efficacy perceptions. Additionally, a combination of oral and reflective practice was found to have a greater influence on efficacy perceptions than a single mode of reflective practice, despite the frequency. Implications for future practice include intentional planning of multiple modes of reflection before, during, and after service-learning, and investment in the layering of service learning experiences over time in order to allow the constructs of self-efficacy and collective efficacy to develop.

AB  - This article examines three strategies that seem to hold particular promise in addressing the root causes of aggressive, violent behavior among young people. These strategies are improved health and counseling services for expectant and new mothers, particularly those at risk for child abuse or neglect; school reform that emphasizes the importance of smaller, more personalized learning environments for students, particularly in high school; and the use of service learning (linking classroom learning to community service) to promote the intellectual, psychological, and moral development of young people. It has been found that the earliest months of life are a time in which violent behavior can be cultivated. Fortunately, prenatal and infant-care programs can dramatically reduce cases of child abuse, welfare dependency, alcohol and drug abuse, and maternal and juvenile arrests. For older children, smaller schools have been shown to improve attendance rates, lower dropout rates, and lessen discipline problems. These schools bring students closer to adults, meaning that young people are less likely to fall through the cracks. Other strategies, such as service learning, can result in significant improvement in student achievement, especially when that learning is combined with an academically rigorous classroom education.

AB  - This final report discusses the activities and outcomes of the Mentor/Advisor Project, a program designed to promote positive self-concept and school success for high school students at risk of or experiencing emotional and behavioral disabilities in rural Vermont. The Project involved small groups of heterogeneous students (i.e., those with and without behavior problems) facilitated by an adult mentor, who engaged in community service learning activities and individualized projects that built upon their strengths and interests. Through these applied activities, students learned skills in the areas of collaboration, problem solving, conflict resolution, and self-appraisal. The mentor/advisors were volunteers from the school staff and received on-going support and consultation. Evaluation of the model was conducted in 1 school over a 4-year period. The evaluation process consisted of quantitative and qualitative components. Students (n=102), parents, and teachers involved with the Mentor/Advisor Project were all included in the evaluation process, in addition to a matched control group. Students indicated that participation in the mentor groups had a positive effect on their relationships and increased their self-esteem, and parents noted their children gained skills as a result of their participation, particularly in the area of conflict resolution.

AB  - With the current interest and allocation of resources accorded service learning comes a growing need to clarify the varied ideological perspectives on school and society that underline service learning activities and programs. Drawing on an evaluation of Stanford's Service Learning 2000 project and on a rhetorical analysis of policy talk on service learning, this paper proposes a conceptual scheme that highlights these complexities. It seeks to clarify the ideological, political, and social goals and assumptions embedded in the policy and practice of service learning. Two examples of service learning projects funded in part by the Stanford Service Learning 2000 minigrants program are highlighted. Data were obtained from interviews with and surveys of teachers and students, classroom observations, and project reports submitted by the teachers. The first project stressed charity and the cultivation of civic duty and altruism among the students. The second project focused on transformative education, using systemic and critical analysis to bring about social change. Findings distinguish among the moral, political, and pedagogical goals that motivate supporters of service learning--the moral domain, the political domain, and the pedagogical domain. Although charity is an admirable goal, educators must ask the questions "who and for what?" By focusing on charity rather than change, by emphasizing noncontroversial issues, and by framing controversial issues in noncontroversial ways, educators forego many opportunities for meaningful, reflective analysis and transformative experiences. By linking social analysis and action, service learning frameworks can facilitate powerful educational experiences. (LMI)

AB  - The purpose of this research study is to examine the influence of service-learning on the levels of intercultural sensitivity of high school students at an international school in Hong Kong. Because scholars from the field of service-learning are searching for convincing, empirical evidence from well-designed studies to support claims about the outcomes of service-learning, this study employs a triangulated research design with both quantitative and qualitative components. Using the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) based on Milton Bennett's Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS), this study analyzes the IDI scores of participants to determine the relationship between levels of intercultural sensitivity and demographic variables as well as variables related to prior participation in four models of service programs. Posttest scores are analyzed to determine whether changes in intercultural sensitivity can be related to the type and duration of involvement in one or more of the four models of service related programs during the academic year of the study. Semi-structured interviews are used to gain further insights from students' perspectives about the influence of participation in service-learning programs on their intercultural sensitivity. This study found that most of the students in this sample have an IDI Overall Profile score in the ethnocentric phase of the DMIS. The IDI Overall Profile score of girls shows a positive relationship for girls. Scores in the Denial/Defense stage showed correlations opposite to those predicted. One service-learning model showed statistically significant posttest gains in the Encapsulated Marginality stage. Qualitative data analysis found that international school students have many formal and informal opportunities to experience difference; that while service-learning can influence the development of intercultural sensitivity, it does not necessarily do so; and that students are able to develop intercultural sensitivity through a variety of life experiences.

Specific questions guiding the research include: What is the level of intercultural sensitivity of high school students attending an international school as measured by the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI)? Does the level of intercultural sensitivity of international high school students increase as a result of participation in four different models of service-learning that vary in terms of type and duration of the academic component? What aspects of service-learning programs and other life experiences not measured by the IDI are attributed by international high school students as influencing their development of intercultural sensitivity?

AB  - This study examines how seventh grade students' educational and social engagement is affected when they participate in a summer Service Learning orientation program. Incoming students participate in a four week summer intervention designed to build Latino students' social capital by engaging them in a local community based orientation curriculum complemented by a week-long Service Learning project. The curriculum and the service project emphasize shared school and community norms, goals and the value of participation through service. MANCOVA analyses were significant for increased grade point average, higher levels of credit completion, better attendance and more extra curricular activities for participants when compared with a matched group of non-participants. Qualitative analyses affirm the statistical significance and suggest that a brief but purposeful intervention during the critical transition periods in students' lives can have a meaningful impact on social and educational engagement.

AB  - This study examines civic identity (i.e., civic values and responsibility to community and to people) in middle childhood, a previously unexplored developmental period in the civic engagement literature, and how adults and socialization processes in the home and school contexts are associated with children's civic outcomes. Middle childhood is a relevant time to explore these processes, as children at this age begin to demonstrate more complex understandings and interactions with their social world (Eccles, 1999). Thus, it is a key time to build a foundation for future civic engagement. This study aimed to determine: 1) child and family characteristics associated with civic outcomes in middle childhood; 2) the extent to which parents' humanitarian values and civic beliefs (social and government trust) are associated with children's civic identity and the ways that parents share these values/beliefs with children; and 3) the types of civic activities used by teachers in the upper elementary grades and the extent to which teacher practices are associated with children's civic outcomes. Survey data were collected from 407 ethnically and economically diverse upper-elementary students (4th-6th grades), their parents (N = 388), and teachers ( N = 22) from seven schools in Southern California. Aim 1: Results indicated that being female, having a need to affiliate with others, and being from a low-income family were associated with children's civic identity. Aim 2: Additionally, parents who more strongly endorsed humanitarian values and were more trusting of others had children with greater civic outcomes, and parents transmitted these values/beliefs to their children by being civically engaged themselves. Parent mistrust in the government was also associated with greater civic outcomes, but only for children from low-income families. Aim 3: Teachers reported using multiple types of civic activities in the classroom, and civic learning opportunities (e.g., service learning) were associated with children's feelings of responsibility to people. This study provides evidence of a civic identity in middle childhood and shows that parents and teachers both matter for children's civic outcomes. Findings also suggest that parents' civic engagement and concrete civic learning experiences are particularly meaningful to children's civic outcomes during middle childhood.

AB  - This evaluation study provides descriptive information about the implementation and outcomes of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (CCLC) program in West Virginia, from September 2012 through May 2013. The report draws on information from online surveys of directors of 30 CCLC programs and from school teachers for 4,102 participating students. Most participating students were in the elementary grades. The mean number of days students attended ranged from about 2 to 93 days, depending on the program. Teachers perceived the greatest improvements in participating students' behaviors related to promptness and quality of homework turned in, overall academic performance, and participation in class. Regarding CCLC program volunteers, the largest sources were K-12 service learning programs, parents and faculty members, local businesses, and postsecondary service learning programs. The groups with which program directors reported the greatest level of success were "other" (100%) and service learning K-12 (99.7%). Regarding work with partners, the two most frequent types of support received from partners were programming and resources. Partnerships engaged in funding, programming, resources, and training were reported to be the most effective. Regarding professional development, the topics best attended by program directors were programming, STEM/STEAM, and program evaluation. As for parent and community involvement, more than half of program directors indicated they either had no family components in their programs or that they were, at best, well below target goals. Of those who reported success in this area, three main themes emerged as reasons for their successes: (a) the right types of activities; (b) ongoing, even daily contact with parents; and (c) a shared commitment to the program, which involved engaging parents in meaningful work toward program goals. Program directors reported offering more than 600 substance abuse prevention activities, involving more than 7,000 students and nearly 1,600 adults. Nearly three quarters of program directors found the continuous improvement process for after school moderately or very helpful. Likewise, the great majority found the West Virginia Department of Education monitoring visits moderately or very helpful. The following are appended: (1) Teacher Questionnaire; (2) Program Director Questionnaire; and (3) Program Directors' Comments.

AB  - This evaluation study provides information about the implementation and outcomes of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program in West Virginia, from September 2014 through May 2015. The report draws on information from online surveys of 23 directors of 21st CCLC programs and from school teachers for 929 of the 11,299 participating students. It also draws on West Virginia General Summative Assessment (WVGSA) scores provided by the West Virginia Department of Education (WVDE) for students who participated in a 21st CCLC program for at least 30 days (1,864), and a matching group of 1,864 nonparticipants used as a control. The students were grouped by grade level and compared in mathematics and English/language arts (ELA) using scale score means for Grades 4-11. Most participating students were in the elementary grades. The mean number of days students attended ranged from about 2 to 108 days, depending on the program. Teachers perceived the greatest improvements in participating students' behaviors related to turning in homework on time, participating in class, completing homework to teachers' satisfaction, and academic performance. Regarding 21st CCLC program volunteers, the largest sources were K-12 service learning programs (36.8%), parents (20.2%), and higher education service learning programs (14.8%). The groups with which program directors reported the greatest level of success were higher education service learning programs (3.8 on a 4.0 scale), community organizations (3.6 of 4.0), and K-12 service learning programs (3.6 of 4.0). Regarding work with partners, the most frequent types of support received were program resources (28.2%), programming (22.1%), and joint planning (18.0%). With the exception of a few activities, all program directors who had engaged in the various partnership activities considered them to be effective. Program directors said they needed more professional development in program sustainability, more technical assistance in program evaluation, and more information resources in STEM/STEAM. As for parent and community involvement, more than 60% of program directors indicated they either had no family component or they had only slight success in their efforts to involve parents/guardians or other adult community members. In responses to open-ended questions, program directors indicated programs for students and better student attendance/participation were the most successful. The program directors felt the greatest challenges were personnel issues, parent engagement and support, and funding and sustainability. Program directors were asked to make recommendations for how to improve the program for the future. Most program directors who commented wrote about redundancies in reporting, the hard-to-use WVEIS 21st CCLC data collection interface, and the inability to utilize data entered. The quasi-experimental study in mathematics using scale score means for Grades 4-11 showed the observed differences were not statistically significant. The quasi-experimental study in ELA using scale score means for Grades 4-11 also showed that the observed differences were not statistically significant. The following are appended: (1) Detailed Description of Study Methods; (2) Survey Questionnaires; and (3) Informed Consent Forms. [For the 2013-2014 report, see ED569701.]

AB  - We examined the degree to which civic learning activities and civic discussion in the classroom were associated with children's civic engagement in the upper elementary grades. We also explored the types of civic activities used by teachers during middle childhood. Survey data were collected from 359 ethnically and economically diverse 4th-6th grade students ("M" age = 10.56, 56% female), their parents, and teachers ("n" = 20) from six public schools in Southern California. The results of path analyses showed that teachers' greater use of civic learning activities was associated with higher levels of social responsibility to people and civic values in students. However, general civic discussion was not associated with any indicators of children's civic engagement. Additionally, teachers reported using numerous types of civic activities, thus showing the diversity in "civic learning" across classrooms. Practical implications for elementary civic education are discussed.

AB  - This study focused on possible impacts of service-learning activities which were made available to 30-35 under-served students at an alternative high school. There were seven distinct service-learning projects conducted over a three month period. Most of these projects were in semi-wilderness settings, such as county parks and state parks, and included trail maintenance and repair, erosion control, and improvement. The researcher met weekly with the teachers and administrators to record their perceptions of change in students' behavior and attitudes toward school, their teachers, and their classmates. These staff sessions began with written Likert-style surveys which included an invitation to elaborate on the items in a brief written comment. Finally, the faculty were interviewed as a group, and asked to comment on their perceptions of change, or lack of change. The data collected suggested a trend of agreement that the service-learning projects were having a positive impact on student behavior, attitude, and general outlook towards school.

AB  - Service-learning is an educational method that engages students in service to their communities, through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences, as a means of enriching their academic learning, promoting personal growth, and helping them to develop the skills needed for productive citizenship. Secondary schools are integrating community service-learning into the curriculum as an element of the high school experience. A review of statistics on urban youth involvement nationally notes that most young people are not involved in community service-learning. The review of statistics on urban youth involvement further states that African American students perform more service-learning annually than any other racial group, that urban schools do not prioritize community service-learning, and that many agencies look to community service-learning to engage low-income urban youth in positive action. The purposes of the study were to evaluate the experiences of high school students who participated in the service-learning program; to clarify the outcomes of service-learning participation for students as described by influentials who support and promote service-learning; and to gain an understanding of the possible impact service-learning experiences had on high school students. The study measured selected outcomes in high school students as a result of participation and involvement in the community service-learning program to realize the goal of responsible citizenship. Further, the study was designed to ascertain if students who experienced community service-learning displayed more positive attitudes toward learning than did students who had not experienced community service-learning. The study population comprised 150 urban high school students who enrolled and were programmed in the general course of study program. The findings of the study indicated that students who were involved in the experiential community service-learning program demonstrated positive and significant gains in the following areas: planning and career exploration behaviors, responsive attitudes toward others, competence to act upon the feeling of concern for others, feelings of self-esteem and personal adequacy in social situations, and school attendance and acceptable school behaviors.

AB  - This thesis explored the relationship between students' participation in a one-semester service-learning course and their self-perceptions of diversity, defined as appreciation of difference and awareness of structural inequality (O'Grady, 2000). Specifically, the study explicated the relationship between each of the two diversity components and race, gender, service hours required, and prior service participation. The study utilized existing data from the Curricular Service Learning Survey, a locally developed instrument. Results indicated that women's perceptions of appreciation of difference were significantly greater than men's perceptions, whereas students' perceptions of awareness of structural inequality differed significantly by race and gender. Blocked hierarchical regressions revealed that students' prior service experience and high school service requirement predicted a significant but small amount of the variance (6%) in their perceptions of their appreciation of difference and that prior service experience predicted a significant amount of the variance (6%) in their awareness of structural inequality.

AB  - Recent educational changes in China such as the decentralization policy and the marketization of education have introduced concepts such as performativity, competition and effectiveness to the education sector and they have become part of the educational lexicon. Such policy shifts force more local participation in teacher education programmes and schools are now identified as the prime site for offering relevant professional learning activities to teachers. However, interestingly, research on professional development of teachers in China has not devoted significant attention to the voices of teachers. This paper examines how teachers from seven schools in Guangdong Province view the effectiveness of these school-based learning activities within the new context of educational change.

AB  - Background: Leadership training programs by experiential learning among adolescents are very popular worldwide and in particular developed countries, but there exists few studies which formally assessed their impact on the psychological wellbeing of program participants. This study evaluated the effectiveness of leadership training programs on self-esteem and self-efficacy among adolescents. Methodology/Principal Findings: a total of 180 students of the same grade of one secondary school were randomized into an intervention (n = 50) and a control group (n = 130). The students in the intervention group participated in a 6-month program of leadership training and service learning, while the control group did not participate in any training. Their self-esteem and self-efficacy were assessed by Rosenberg Self-Esteem questionnaire and Chinese Adaptation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale, respectively, before and after the program. Both scales have been recognized internationally as valid and reliable survey instruments to measure these psychological attributes. The scores were compared by Student's tests according to gender. A total of 180 students were enrolled during the study period October, 2009 to May, 2010. Their mean age was 15.18 years (0.62) and 56.7% were male. Students allocated to the intervention and control group had statistically similar demographic characteristics except gender (male 36.0% vs. 64.6%, p = 0.001). Overall, the self-esteem scores increased by 1.28 and decreased by 0.30 (p = 0.161) while the self-efficacy scores increased by 0.26 and decreased by 0.76 (p = 0.429) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Among female students, the intervention group showed significant improvements in both self-esteem (2.38 vs. 20.24, p, 0.001) and self-efficacy (1.32 vs. -0.04, p = 0.043). Conclusions/Significance: Leadership training program were not found to be effective to enhance self-esteem and self-efficacy in adolescents, except girls who showed modest increase in these outcomes. Future research should assess the reasons why these programs are effective among female.

Students also participate in weekly community service-learning sessions. Fifty-five HSP students and 29 peers (who were not involved in the program), completed a survey measuring: students' connection to, pride in, and responsibility for their community; civic attitudes; and career knowledge and preparedness. HSP teachers, community members, and students were also interviewed about program outcomes. Compared to other peers, HSP students tended to report feeling more connected to their community and school and to agree that they had career-related skills. Participants believed that service-learning contributed to these outcomes by making connections between school and community life and by exposing students to a variety of careers.

AB  - Like many other culturally and linguistically diverse students, Native Hawaiians are over-represented among those in special education, score lower on standardized achievement tests, and are at greater risk for dropping-out. The Hawaiian Studies Program (HSP) was a culturally relevant academic program that incorporated learning about Hawaiian culture with high school curriculum in science, social studies, and English. Students spent one full day each week participating in community service-learning. This study examined HSP graduates? perceptions of their high school experiences and the effects of the program on the personal and career development of these young adults. Methods included a survey of 22 former HSP students and semi-structured interviews with 12 of the respondents. Data suggested that HSP graduates recalled high school as interesting and motivating. Many were working toward careers in medicine, education and environmental science because of the program?s emphasis on these disciplines. Graduates also reported effects on self-confidence and knowledge of Hawaiian culture. They reported a strong sense of connection to and responsibility for the community and volunteered widely in community affairs.

AB  - Service Learning is a pedagogy in which the student must participate directly in a service-oriented project, which addresses a real community need. This study focused on the effect of service learning in the curriculum. Research was conducted over service learning, its implementation, and its effects. In addition, the study looks at how one junior high school implemented service learning into their curriculum and the difficulties involved in creating a more intense program. It was discovered that service learning was often not integrated into the curriculum as expected, teachers often did not require students to reflect on their experiences, and teachers did not spend adequate time preparing for service projects. Each of these characteristics are viewed as requirements for the pedagogy of service learning, and in their absence the practice of service learning seems to have a lesser positive effect on the students.

AB  - The main purpose of this exploratory investigation was to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive career education program at the third and fifth grade levels, as expressed by selected students in an experimental group and a control group. Specifically, this study attempted to determine whether significant differences in academic achievement, career knowledge and attitude existed between an experimental group which received the career education program treatment and a control group which did not. The settings for this study were two suburban school districts adjacent to a large midwestern city. The experimental school district and a control school district were matched on the basis of nine criteria. Third and fifth grades were selected as the target population for both the experimental and control school districts. The subjects were randomly selected and assigned to the treatment group or comparison group. These students were selected individually from complete class roles. Use was made of multivariate analysis of covariance as the selected statistical technique in the analysis of each null hypothesis. Furthermore, a t test was used to test the hypothesis that the career education treatment received by the experimental group subject, and as measured by pretest scores on nine learner outcome variables, was statistically significant in comparison with the control group. For each statistical methodology, the values were tested against a critical value of .05. Third grade students showed significant difference in four of the career knowledge and attitude subgroups as a direct result of the comprehensive career education treatment. Significant correlation between the treatment and outcomes for fifth grade students was determined for only one of the eight variables as measured by the test instrument. Qualitative data collected in this study showed significance in favor of the treatment group. A significantly higher number of experimental students at grades three and five demonstrated skills in resume writing, job application completion, job interviews, service learning planning, and organizational skills as determined by classroom teachers. Conclusions were drawn from the findings and recommendations were made for career education programs and for further research.

AB  - This action research project reports the trial of an action learning pedagogy in the citizenship education curriculum of a primary school in Hong Kong. The project was a response to Learning to Learn - The Way Forward in Curriculum Development published by the Curriculum Development Council (CDC) in 2001. The document recommended that implementation of moral and civic education should be child-centred and should allow students to participate actively in learning. The study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods. It consisted of three cycles of action research: (1) demonstration teaching by the researcher; (2) classroom teaching by a teacher in the school; (3) service learning. Five moral values: respect for others, civic and social concern, collaboration, participation, and self-regulation were identified from the CDC document, in order to investigate changes in the second and third cycles. The response and reactions of students suggested that action learning was effective in the aspects of knowledge, skills and values in the first cycle. However, the reactions of the four teacher-observers caused changes in implementation of action learning pedagogy in the second cycle. In the second cycle, the classroom teaching conducted by a teacher suggested that an action learning pedagogy provided opportunities for participation. Data illustrated that students displayed significant change in collaboration and participation but did not show obvious change in the other three values. After initial problems, the experimental teacher became more confident and competent in use of the action learning pedagogy. The third cycle was a service learning project in a special school for serious mentally handicapped children. A questionnaire on the five moral values was conducted before and after the service learning project. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: Part I was composed of 30 items; each described a scenario of five moral behaviours; and Part II focused on 10 moral values. Results of Part I did not show many significant changes. However, the results of Part II showed significant changes in the post-test survey. Qualitative data indicated that students demonstrated significant changes in the five moral values identified from the CDC document. The results of the research were partially encouraging. Students' learning was enhanced. However, the results also revealed problems in the implementation of the action learning pedagogy, for example the teachers' workload at a time of rapid reforms of the education system.

AB  - This review of recent literature examines the research on the impact of service-learning on student retention. The theoretical framework of the review draws on both Tinto's model of student attrition and Knowles's theory of adult learning, which together suggest that academic and social integration, active participation and engagement in learning, and application and relevancy of the subject-matter under study are key factors in student success. The role of these factors has been confirmed in a growing body of research around learning experiences in general and, as this review shows, particularly in service-learning experiences. Suggestions are made for how future research might expand and critically deepen this evidence and offers some implications for service-learning as a means of improving student retention.

AB  - The Pennsylvania Department of Education's Learn and Serve America K-12 Grant Program distributes funds from the Corporation for National Service to schools to develop and expand service learning programs throughout Pennsylvania. The 1995-96 grant program is currently funding 101 school-based programs (70 recipients of continuing funds from the previous year, 21 recipients of new full-year minigrants, and 10 half-year grant recipients). The grant program's primary objectives are as follows: foster civic responsibility; enhance the academic curriculum; and promote students' personal growth by using the service learning model of preparation, service, reflection, and celebration. In an evaluation of the 1995-96 grant programs that included site visits to each grant recipient, most programs appeared to have met the program's objectives. Although many programs integrated meaningful community service into the academic program, others did not. Those programs with integrated projects, strong collaborations, and high levels of student participation were generally the most effective; however, nearly every program had a positive and successful program year.

AB  - The article discusses how service learning improves the development of high school students. The authors discusses the role of service learning in the Positive Youth Development perspective, a theory which suggests that youth values and motivations in combination with social experiences can improve the character of young people and promote civic contributions. They comment that service learning helps youth develop problem solving abilities and civic motivation. The participation of students in the Madison County Youth in Public Service program, in which students collaborated with government agencies to serve communities, is noted. The effects of voluntary and mandatory participation in public service on student attitudes are noted.

AB  - Abstract: Using longitudinal data from Grades 8 to 11 of the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development, a longitudinal study involving U.S. adolescents, we examined the developmental trajectories of multiple components of civic engagement, and the effects of youth development program participation and participation in another major domain of youth engagement (religious activity) on these trajectories. A set of two-level, hierarchical linear models (time-varying measures of civic engagement at level 1 and covariates at level 2) were conducted. Results indicated that the components of civic engagement have different starting points and growth rates during adolescence and that the contextual factors have differing effects dependent on the civic engagement component. By understanding how the components of civic engagement develop during adolescence, and the contextual factors that affect those trajectories, practitioners can gain more nuanced insights into how and when to effectively encourage youth civic engagement.

AB  - This small-scale study investigates the effects of community service learning (CSL) projects or a cultural presentation on the development of the cultural understanding of low- and high-intermediate L2 students. Fifty-two learners in four sections of two Spanish classes in Canada participated in the study. The participants also completed pre- and postquestionnaires which explored their attitudes towards the target language and culture. The results show that, after completing their CSL or cultural presentation projects, the CSL learners had more positive attitudes towards the target language and culture than those who worked on the presentation. In addition, the high-intermediate CSL participants saw an increase in their self-confidence as L2 speakers. However, this was not the case with the low-intermediate CSL students, whose CSL experience may have been inhibited by their L2 proficiency and problems in the delineation of their CSL duties.

AB  - This project study addressed the effects of combined STEM and Project-Based Learning (PBL) in an inclusion model within an urban high school in the Northwest United States. Although there has been an increased focus on STEM and PBL, little is known about the impact of these initiatives on students with disabilities. This study was guided by Ginsberg and Wlodkowski's 4 conditions of motivation framework and Glasser's choice theory. Using a sequential mixed methods design, the research questions explored the efficacy of combined STEM initiatives utilizing PBL as a primary instructional strategy on academic achievement, behavior, and attendance in inclusion classrooms. Qualitative survey responses were coded for themes. The findings indicated that 19 out of 49 teachers perceived an overall positive effect of combined STEM-PBL but reported concern about the rigors of STEM for students with disabilities as well as a need for additional professional development. Quantitative data, including test data, behavior referrals, and attendance reports from 2008-2013 ( n = 2,178), were analyzed using a Mann Whitney U, ANOVA, and MANOVA. Findings indicated significant differences in math and reading scores for 2008-2012 as well as differences in attendance but no significant difference between the 2008-2009 and implementation year 2012-2013. The results indicated the need for additional professional development for teachers to address the effective use of STEM and PBL strategies in inclusive classrooms. The recommendations also included implementing combined STEM-PBL strategies. This study affects positive social change by communicating the effectiveness of STEM schools using PBL and by providing a model for professional development to improve learning outcomes in inclusive classrooms.

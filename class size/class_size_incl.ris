AB  - Reported are background information and initial analyses of Tennessee's Project STAR, a legislatively authorized study of class size. The aim of the project was to identify causes and effects of differences in elementary school class size. Primary analyses were conducted on kindergarten data for 1985-1986. During that year, 42 school districts and 79 individual schools participated in the project. Core variables were three classroom conditions: (1) small class, defined as one teacher with about 15 students; (2) regular class, defined as one teacher with about 26 students; and (3) regular class with a teacher aide. These three classroom conditions were investigated: (1) in inner-city, suburban, urban or small city, and rural locations; (2) in relation to pupil variables (race, sex, socioeconomic status); and (3) in relation to either achievement measures (mathematics, sounds and letters, words and sentences, total reading scores) or noncognitive measures (motivation, self-concept). While the unit of data collection was the individual pupil, the primary unit of analysis was the class. The report presents tables and information concerning two comparisons among class types and three comparisons among the four locations. Findings seemed to favor the small class condition slightly. Supplementary analyses are briefly reported. (RH)

AB  - A 4-year longitudinal experiment conducted in Tennessee examined class-size effects on student achievement in kindergarten through grade 3. The Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project included more than 7,000 students per year in 79 schools in 42 school systems. Class size categories were: small class (13-17 students), regular class (22-26 students), and regular class with full-time teacher aide. Students and teachers were randomly assigned to class categories. The study found that students in small classes made significantly (statistically and educationally) greater gains than other students. In addition, minority students in small classes benefitted more than minority students in other class categories. It was also determined that gains achieved in kindergarten were maintained through third grade. Analyses showed a continuing, powerful class-size effect in all locations. However, no consistent teacher-aide effect was evident in the study. The Lasting Benefits Study (LBS) had already analysed data from a sample of STAR pupils through grades 4 and 5 in an attempt to determine whether gains STAR students achieved in small classes carried through to those grades. The LBS found that students who were in STAR small classes at least in grade 3 were statistically and educationally ahead of other STAR students. Three appendices include STAR data collection instruments, primary and extended analyses designs, and analysis of variance for cognitive outcomes. (Author/JPT)

AB  - This paper presents findings of a study that examined the relationship between the performance (as measured by test results) of pupils in classrooms with full-time teacher aides. The Student Teacher Achievement Ratio project (STAR) was implemented in Tennessee from 1985 through 1989 to study the effects of class size on student achievement and development in grades K-3. Data for this paper were derived from an analysis of data from Project STAR and its derivative studies. Project STAR compared the results of three situations: (1) small classes with a 1:15 teacher-pupil ratio (S condition); (2) regular classes with a 1:24 teacher-pupil ratio (R condition); and (3) regular classes with a full-time teacher aide (RA condition). In nearly all comparisons, the small classes had the highest student test outcomes, followed by regular-sized classes with aides and regular-sized classes. However, pupils who were retained a grade before entering the STAR program benefitted most in their test scores from the RA condition and often least from the S condition. Implications are that retention fails to help students improve test outcomes and that small-class intervention does not remedy already-defined test-score deficits after students have experienced regular classes. Thirteen tables and an appendix containing statistical data are included. (LMI)

AB  - Beginning in 1991–1992 a local school system spent local funds to implement class-size reductions (grades 1–3) to 1:15 as a way to improve the early schooling of primary pupils. Pupil math and reading achievement evaluations at grade 3 (1994) showed statistically significant differences between 17 classes of 1:15 and 26 classes of 1:25 in 4 matched "experimental" and 7 "control" schools with effect sizes ranging from .65 to .73. Based on these results, education leaders fully implemented 1:15 in grades 1–2 with local funding in all elementary schools for the 1994–1995 and 1995–1996 school years.

AB  - Confusion over the concepts of class size and pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) creates a conundrum for researchers, policy makers, and practitioners. An examination of how these two concepts are different is presented in this paper. A review of the literature suggests that class-size reduction makes a positive overall difference in student achievement, whereas an increase in the PTR is associated with lower student achievement. To explore this finding, a study on the two concepts was performed using 104 elementary schools and 12 secondary schools. The results show that class-size reductions do influence student outcomes positively but that PTR changes do not influence student outcomes significantly. A number of recommendations for future research are made, such as the importance of professional and policy persons using the terms PTR and class size with precision; that researchers continue to conduct studies on both PTR and class size; that researchers reanalyze prior studies using consistent definitions; and that policy-related research focus on ways to benefit students directly. Some implications for funding, policy implementation, probable roadblocks, and plans for future studies are provided. Contains 26 references. (RJM)

AB  - This manual draws together evolving information about how group size influences what the group does and how learning tasks may be designed and employed to accomplish desired outcomes. The manual includes ideas from research on class size and its outcomes; theories of learning and development; and validated experiences of expert educators. It provides information and tips for class-size advocates to use in working at the early elementary level. Following an introduction and executive summary, the second section of the manual offers tips, hints, and strategies for getting involved politically to support candidates who advocate for small classes. The next section summarizes what research says about best ways to implement appropriate-size classes in grades K-3, stressing that small classes are not an extension of project-driven pupil-teacher-ratio efforts. The next section provides a sample evaluation outline for assessing class-size change. Included is a list of references used in the manual and selected sources of class-size information in a bibliography. Appended are a comparison of class size and pupil-teacher ratio, a class-size fact sheet, and a listing of research-supported theories to support small classes. The manual will be revised periodically as new information becomes available. (WFA)

We estimate the causal effects of class size on achievement tests by using discontinuous changes in class size under the Japanese public compulsory education system. We employ a value‐added model that uses achievement tests conducted at two different times during the same school year. Our results show that a reduction in class size has significantly positive effects on Japanese language test scores in the sixth grade, especially at schools in wealthy areas. However, we find no evidence that a universal small class policy closes the achievement gap among schools

AB  - Investigated the effect of school size (number of students and classrooms, class size, perceived crowdedness) on various educational and environmental factors in Saudi Arabia, based on a 1990 survey of 1,031 boys' schools. The survey included site observations, personal interviews, and a questionnaire for school principals. Factors investigated included school level (elementary, intermediate, secondary), ownership, spatial elements (library, cafeteria, laboratories, lecture hall, art room, playground), availability of educational technology, building attributes (room sizes, climate control, etc.), school maintenance, principals' authority in running schools, and educational goal achievement. Results show that large schools were more satisfying and had higher levels of achievement. However, large schools were associated with problems of maintenance, daily supervision, and less authority available to principals as school administrators.

AB  - This study evaluated the extent to which first-grade class size predicted child outcomes and observed classroom processes for 651 children (in separate classrooms). Analyses examined observed child-adult ratios and teacher-reported class sizes. Smaller classrooms showed higher quality instructional and emotional support, although children were somewhat less likely to be engaged. Teachers in smaller classes rated typical children in those classes as more socially skilled and as showing less externalizing behavior and reported more closeness toward them. Children in smaller classes performed better on literacy skills. Larger classrooms showed more group activities directed by the teacher, teachers and children interacted more often, and children were more often engaged. Lower class sizes were not of more benefit (or harm) as a function of the child's family income. First-grade class size in the range typical of present-day classrooms in the United States predicts classroom social and instructional processes as well as relative changes in social and literacy outcomes from kindergarten to first grade.

AB  - The impact of class size on student achievement remains a thorny question for educational decision makers. Meta-analyses of empirical studies emphasise the absence of class-size effects but detractors have argued against such pessimistic conclusions because many of the underlying studies have not paid attention to the endogeneity of class-size. This paper uses a stringent method to address the endogeneity problem using TIMSS data on 45 countries. We measure the class size effect by relating the difference in a student's achievement across subjects to the difference in his/her class-size across subjects. This (subject-differenced) within-pupil achievement production function avoids the problem of the non-random matching of children to specific schools, and to classes within schools. The results show a statistically significant effect of class size for 16 countries but in only 10 of them is the effect negative, and the effect size is very small in most cases. Several robustness tests are carried out, including control for students' subject-specific ability and subject-specific teacher characteristics, and correction for possible measurement error. Thus, our stringent approach to addressing the problem endogeneity confirms the findings of meta-analyses that find little support for class size effects. We find that class-size effects are smaller in resource-rich countries than in developing countries, supporting the idea that the adverse effect of larger classes increases with class-size. We also find that class size effects are smaller in regions with higher teacher quality.

AB  - The impact of class size on student achievement remains a thorny question for educational decision makers. Meta‐analyses of empirical studies emphasize the absence of class‐size effects but detractors have argued against such pessimistic conclusions because many of the underlying studies have not paid attention to the endogeneity of class size. This article uses a stringent method to address the endogeneity problem using Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data on 47 countries. We measure the class size effect by relating the difference in a student's achievement across subjects to the difference in his/her class size across subjects. This (subject‐differenced) within‐pupil achievement production function avoids the problem of the non‐random matching of children to specific schools, and to classes within schools. The results show a statistically significant negative effect of class size in 14 countries, but the effect size is small in most cases. Several robustness tests are carried out, including control for students’ subject‐specific ability and subject‐specific teacher characteristics, and correction for possible measurement error. Thus, our approach to addressing the endogeneity problem confirms the findings of meta‐analyses that find little support for class size effects. Additionally, we find that class size effects are smaller in countries with higher teacher quality

AB  - The effect of class size on student achievement has long been of concern to educators, parents, and scholars. In Israeli public schools today, class size is partly determined using a rule proposed by Maimonides in the 12th century. This rule induces a nonlinear and non-monotonic relationship between enroll- ment size and class size. We use this relationship to construct instrumental variables estimates of the effect of class size on the test scores of Israeli 4th and 5th graders in 1991 and 3rd graders in 1992. Because the up-and-down pattern in class size induced by Maimonides' rule matches a similar pattern in test scores, the rule provides a credible source of exogenous variation for investigation of the causal effect of class size on student achievement. Our use of Maimonides' rule can be viewed as an application of Campbell's (1969) regression-discontinuity design to the class size question. The results of this application show that reductions in class size induce a significant increase in reading and math scores for 5th graders and a smaller increase in reading scores for 4th graders. In contrast, there is little evidence of any association between class size and the test scores of 3rd graders, although this finding may result from problems with the 1992 wave of the testing program. The estimates also suggest that the gains from small classes are largest for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Besides being of metho- dological interest and providing new evidence on the class size question, these findings are of immediate policy interest in Israel where legislation to reduce the maximum class size is pending

AB  - The twelfth century rabbinic scholar Maimonides proposed a maximum class size of 40. This same maximum induces a nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationship between grade enrollment and class size in Israeli public schools today. Maimonides' rule of 40 is used here to construct instrumental variables estimates of effects of class size on test scores. The resulting identification strategy can be viewed as an application of Donald Campbell's regression-discontinuity design to the class-size question. The estimates show that reducing class size induces a significant and substantial increase in test scores for fourth and fifth graders, although not for third graders. © 2000 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

AB  - An instrumental variables (IV) identification strategy that exploits statutory class size caps shows significant achievement gains in smaller classes in Italian primary schools. Gains from small classes are driven mainly by schools in Southern Italy, suggesting a substantial return to class size reductions for residents of the Mezzogiorno. In addition to high unemployment and other social problems, however, the Mezzogiorno is distinguished by pervasive manipulation of standardized test scores, a finding revealed in a natural experiment that randomly assigns school monitors. IV estimates also show that small classes increase score manipulation. Dishonest scoring appears to be a consequence of teacher shirking in answer sheet transcription, rather than cheating by either students or teachers. Estimates of a causal model for achievement with two endogenous variables, class size and score manipulation, suggest that the effects of class size on measured achievement are driven entirely by the relationship between class size and manipulation. These findings show how consequential score manipulation can arise even in assessment systems with few NCLB-style accountability concerns.

AB  - Much of the economic education literature suggests that the principles of economics class size does not significantly affect student performance. However, study methods have varied in terms of the aggregation level (student or class), the measure of performance (TUCE or course letter grade), and the class size measure (e.g., students who completed both the TUCE pretest and posttest). The authors perform an experiment with principles students using total exam points as the dependent variable in a model to explain student performance. By using the same instructor for all sections, the authors control variation in instruction, lecture material, and topic coverage; they also account for variation in student abilities. In contrast to many other studies, the authors find statistically significant evidence that small class size has a positive impact on student performance.

AB  - This study examines the effect of class size on student achievement in Bangladesh using national secondary school survey data. A Ministry of Education rule regarding allocation of teachers to secondary grades is exploited to construct an instrument for class size. This rule causes a discontinuity between grade enrolment and class size thereby generating exogenous variation in the latter. It is found that OLS and IV estimates of class size effects have perverse signs: both yield a positive coefficient on the class size variable. The results suggest that reduction in class size in secondary grades is not efficient in a developing country like Bangladesh. Last, as by-product, some evidence is found suggesting that greater competition among schools improve student achievement

AB  - Do smaller classes boost achievement mainly by helping teachers impart specific academic skills to students with low academic achievement? Or do they do so primarily by helping teachers engage poorly behaving students? The analysis uses the grade 3 to 4 transition in San Diego Unified School District as a source of exogenous variation in class size (given a California law funding small classes until grade 3). Grade 1 report cards allow separate identification of low-effort and low-achieving students. Results indicate that elicitation of effort or engagement, rather than the teaching of specific skills, may be the dominant channel by which small classes influence disadvantaged students

AB  - Much of the debate over the allocation of education resources focuses on the alleged benefits of smallness—of classroom or school—and is based on evidence from small-scale studies. This paper reframes the question in terms of cohort size. Using national data, we find that a 10% increase in kindergarten enrollment yields a 0.5% increase in cohort shrinkage across early grade transitions, which implies that larger cohorts feature higher rates of retention. Consistent with previous work on class and school size in more restricted settings, this cohort-tracking exercise provides robust evidence at the national level that smallness confers benefits.

AB  - Staff of the Tennessee State University Class Size Project investigated effects of a 1:15 teacher/pupil ratio on first grade students' reading and mathematics achievement, behavior, attendance, and self concept. Participants were first grade pupils attending metropolitan Nashville public schools, who were assigned to an experimental group of seven classes at a school serving more than 50 percent economically disadvantaged students. A primary control group consisted of first grade students from a comparable neighboring school in 1:25 ratio classes, a blind control group was drawn from 35 elementary schools and was matched with the experimental group demographically, and a comparison group consisted of the district's first grade population as a whole. Curriculum studied by all students was from the Metro-Nashville elementary curriculum. Instructional methods were determined by each individual teacher. No instructional interventions were provided during the study and no extra support, supplies, materials, etc. were provided to any group. Initial-year findings favor the 1:15 classes in pupil achievement, behavior, teacher perceptions, and in teacher comments regarding instruction and classroom activity. The 1:15 condition seemed to benefit "free lunch" and "not free lunch" pupils approximately the same, rather than reproducing the usual result, whereby higher SES youth outperform their lower SES peers.

AB  - Effects of teacher-pupil ratio on kindergartners' mastery of reading readiness objectives were studied. The study was part of Tennessee's Project STAR, a 4-year study of class size. About 2,850 students in 38 elementary schools that served 4 types of communities: innercity, suburban, urban, and rural, in 26 Tennessee school systems participated. Basic reading skills objectives were divided into three strands: word identification skills, comprehension skills, and reference and study skills. There were three categories of classes: small, regular, or regular with full-time teacher aide. Data were collected from individual or group profiles indicating mastery or nonmastery of objectives tested. Data were analyzed with a five-way analysis of variance and a cross-tabulation procedure with a chi-square test of significance. Findings suggested that class size was a significant factor in kindergarten reading readiness achievement. Small classes achieved greater mastery on 25 Basic Skills First objectives and 20 comprehension objectives, but not on 5-word identification objectives. Students who did not receive free lunches outscored students who received free or reduced cost lunches in every comparison. Innercity students obtained the lowest scores of the four geographic localities. Students in the lowest attendance category obtained the lowest average scores in each of the three class size conditions. (RH)

AB  - The impact of class size reduction at the early levels on student achievement in various states is discussed in this report. The Tennessee Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) study, a statewide longitudinal evaluation of the effects of class size on student achievement and development in primary grades K-3, analyzed demographic and basic skill data from student records of 2,837 students in classes of various sizes. Findings indicate that small class size is a significant factor in kindergarten readiness achievement and is most effective in cases of low socioeconomic status and high attendance. A second phase of Project STAR, based on observations and interviews with 49 effective first-grade teachers, identified shared characteristics and instructional teaching strategies. Findings indicate that effective teachers have high expectations for student learning, stress family involvement and individual attention, and have clear discipline and organizational policies. An accompanying article by Brad Duggan discusses "Real Issues and False Assumptions about Class Size." Based on observation of the Texas school system, a conclusion is that reductions in class size at early levels has had a significant positive impact on student achievement. (LMI)

AB  - This paper examines the determinants of quality of education across districts of India, as measured by percentage of students getting more than 60 percent marks in Class VIII for each district divided by the percentage of students getting more than 60 percent marks in Class VIII in the state to which the district belongs. The District Report Cards for four years (2004-05 to 2007-08) is used. Initially the analysis is done for 344 districts across 14 districts in India. But, subsequently region wise analysis has also been done. It is found that parents’ education and small class size improve for student achievement. SC/ST Enrollment has a negative impact on student achievement. In cases of northern states, we additionally get that more private enrollment and parents’ family status improve student achievement. Only in the southern region, pupil-teacher ratio is important and for the eastern states, the model used seems inapplicable

AB  - This study examined the contribution of classroom format on teaching effectiveness and achievement in English language arts (ELA) and mathematics. Secondary data analyses of the Measures of Effective Teaching database included 464 US classrooms. Classrooms were defined as self-contained if a generalist teacher provided instruction on all subjects and departmentalized if a specialist teacher provided instruction on a specific subject. Beginning-of-the-year classroom-level covariates were compared. Both ELA and mathematics self-contained classrooms had larger class sizes, served more students of color, served students with lower initial achievement, and had teachers with fewer years of teaching experience but more likely to have a Master's degree. Regression models were used to determine if classroom format predicted teaching effectiveness and achievement while controlling for beginning-of-the-year classroom-level covariates. Departmentalization had a small positive association with higher teaching effectiveness ratings in ELA classes. Classroom format was not a significant predictor of achievement in ELA or math.

AB  - The recent literature on school quality has shown that the school a child attends has significant effects on achievement. However, the literature relating different school characteristics to student achievement has produced mixed results, particularly when using student-level data. Using data from the ECLS-K and a proxy variable model that addresses the problem of measuring school quality, we show that significant effects of teaching and resource quality can be detected from student-level data. We find a significant, positive relationship between school quality and student achievement if school characteristics such as class size and teachers' schooling are treated as noisy measures of school quality. However, this effect is not detected when using models which do not account for measurement error in school quality. Our results suggest that conventional approaches underestimate the effect of school quality by about 50%.

AB  - A reanalysis of norm- and criterion-referenced achievement test data from Tennessee's Student Teacher Achievement Ration Project builds on research utilizing class size and student achievement as an independent and a dependent variable, respectively. The study examined patterns of achievement among minority and white students in small, regular, and regular-with-aide class-size treatments over varying lengths of time and at varying startup years, grades K, 1, 2, and 3. The major differences between the minority and white patterns was the magnitude of the between-treatment subsample means. Differences for white subsamples tended to be compressed relative to differences between minority subsamples; that is, class size appeared to make a bigger difference for minority students than for white students. The findings of this reanalysis support the following conclusions: (1) small class size may be an effective strategy for reducing the achievement gap between whites and minorities in the primary school years; (2) benefits accrue initially in greater measure to minorities than to whites; (3) optimally beneficial treatment begins no later than grade 1; (4) optimally beneficial treatment lasts at least 2 years; (5) the major benefit of small classes for minorities appears to be in preventing rather than remediating achievement disadvantages; (6) the differential effect of small class size for minorities appears to "fade" following 2 years of treatment; and (7) the "fade" phenomenon of early treatments can be neither confirmed nor contradicted by reanalysis.

Research on this topic has been problematic partly because omitted unobservables, like parents' incomes and education levels, are likely to be correlated with class size. Two potential ways to resolve this problem are to exploit either experimental or instrumental variation. In both cases, the methods require that the variation in both class size and the outcome should not be contaminated by other unobservable factors that affect the outcome -- like family background. An alternative approach, which we pursue here, is to take advantage of variation in class size between siblings which allows unobservable family effects to be differenced out. Our aim is to provide estimates of the effect of class size and use these to conduct an evaluation of the costs and benefits of a reduction in class sizes"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site. - Title from PDF file as viewed on 6/14/2005

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between class size and the student outcome – length of time in post-compulsory schooling. Research on this topic has been problematic partly because omitted unobservables, like parents’ incomes and education levels, are likely to be correlated with class size. Two potential ways to resolve this problem are to exploit either experimental or instrumental variation. In both cases, the methods require that the variation in both class size and the outcome should not be contaminated by other unobservable factors that affect the outcome – like family background. An alternative approach, which we pursue here, is to take advantage of variation in class size between siblings which allows unobservable family effects to be differenced out.

AB  - Despite current moves in the UK to limit class sizes fm young children in school, there is still a disturbing lack of research evidence on the effect of class size differences on pupils' educational progress and experience. Past research has concentrated on the effects on outcomes such as pupils' school attainments in basic areas. Much less is known about classroom processes that might mediate any such effects, though such knowledge is more useful for practice and policy. Drawing on a current programme of research at the Institute of Education, University of London, this paper identifies Jive processes likely to be connected to class size: within class grouping practices, the nature and quality of teaching, pupil attention in class, pupil adjustment to school and effects on teachers' morale stress and enthusiasm. Relevent research is reviewed, and in line with this research the paper concentrates on the primary school years

AB  - This article reviews the existing evidence on the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their first years of schooling. It then describes a large-scale longitudinal study of 9,330 children (aged 4-7 yrs) within English Local Education Authorities and presents results for achievement progress in literacy and mathematics during the Key Stage 1 reception year. Using a series of multilevel models, it is shown that there is a relationship with size of class, after various confounding factors have been allowed for, and that there are interactions between class size and initial achievement and between class size and entitlement to free school meals. It is argued that these results, especially the differential effects for different groups of children, could have important implications for educational policy.

AB  - Research and debate on class size differences have focused on relations with achievement and there is little relevant research on what mediating classroom processes might be involved. This paper investigates connections between class size and three aspects of teacher and child behaviour in class: teacher-child interactions, pupil attentiveness and off-task behaviour, and peer relations in class. It reports on a systematic observational study of large (average 33 children) and small (average 19 children) reception classes (children aged 4-5 years). Data come from a sub-sample of 235 children in 39 classes drawn from a longitudinal study of two cohorts of over 10,000 children for three years after entry to English infant schools (aged 4-7 years). Results show that teacher-child contacts are more frequent and personalized in small classes, but that children are more likely to be off-task in large classes (whether with the teacher, other children or when not interacting), and interact more extensively with their peers (through work as well as social contacts). The results raise questions about direct models of teacher effects, and suggest that class size is one contextual influence that presents difficulties and opportunities for teachers and children.

AB  - Despite evidence from the USA that children in small classes of less than 20 do better academically there is still a vociferous debate about the effects of class size differences in schools, and considerable gaps in our understanding of the effects of class size differences. The study had two aims: first, to establish whether class size differences affect pupils' academic achievement; and second, to study connections between class size and classroom processes, which might explain any differences found. The study had a number of features that were designed to be an improvement on previous research. The study followed a large sample of over 10,000 children from school entry through the infant stage, i.e. children aged 4-7 years. It used multilevel statistical procedures to model effects of class size differences while controlling for sources of variation that might affect the relationship with academic achievement. Results showed that there was a clear effect of class size differences on children's academic attainment over the Reception year. In the case of literacy, the lowest attainers on entry to school benefited most from small classes, particularly below 25. It is concluded that much will depend on how teachers adapt their teaching to different class sizes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is still little consensus on whether and how teaching is affected by small and large classes, especially in the case of students in the later primary years. This study investigated effects of class size on teaching of pupils aged 7-11 years. We used a multimethod approach, integrating qualitative information from teachers' end-of-year accounts and data from case studies with quantitative information from systematic observations. Results showed that there was more individual attention in smaller classes, a more active role for pupils, and beneficial effects on the quality of teaching. It is suggested that teachers in both large and small classes need to develop strategies for more individual attention but also recognize the benefits of other forms of learning, for example, group work.

AB  - This article discusses a recent, renewed, call, for smaller class sizes in Hong Kong primary schools and the inference by politicians, parents and teachers that such a move will automatically result in more learner-centred English language teaching and consequently higher English language standards. The central argument in this article is that simply reducing the number of children in a class cannot alone accomplish these goals and that any such move must be accompanied by a shift in thinking and practice related to how the children in these classes are taught, how they are assessed and how teachers and schools are rewarded.

AB  - The causal effect of class size on student performance is investigated using a maximum class size rule of 30 students to generate an instrument for actual class size. The data come from lower secondary schools in Norway, and the initial analysis reveals a small negative class size effect. Further investigations show that the effect varies among student subgroups and that the benefits of smaller classes are larger in schools with a high proportion of students who come from intact families. The second section of the paper uses information about the teachers' grading practices and the students' efforts in class to shed additional light on the revealed patterns of class size effects. Class size effects seem to be conditional on student effort

AB  - The conflicting evidence over class size effects drawn from observational (or correlational) studies on academic achievement or labor market outcomes has provoked great debate in both academic and public policy arenas. The recent experimental evidence from the United States due to the Project STAR demonstration run in Tennessee in the 1980s has added strong evidence in favor of one type of an effect, whereby initial test score gains were maintained only through sustained smaller class sizes. But this has not resolved the debate by any means. In this paper we utilize the unique feature of the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) in that children are sampled for extremely long individual histories of their class size experiences as well as their test score and early adult outcomes. We argue that one implication of Project STAR is that only persistent class size reduction policies may have detectable effects, and so the long histories of the type recorded by the CHDS are necessary to detect class size effects. We account for the observational nature of the CHDS (in that children were not randomly assigned to different class sizes) by examining the long-run trends in test score growth, rather than levels. Consistent with the experimental evidence, we found statistically and economically significant effects of children being assigned to persistently smaller classes on both childhood test score growth as well as on early adult outcomes such as completed education and unemployment experiences. Our analysis points the way towards the unification of experimental and observational evidence on class size effects, as well as highlighting several possible pitfalls in the analysis of observational data on this topic. It also serves as a platform by which further experimental studies on class size might be designed to verify or falsify some of the hypotheses raised in this report, and so further unify the entire literature on this topic.

AB  - Despite the existence of a considerable and current educational literature concerned with the effect of class size on student achievement, the results of attempts to empirically identify the relationship between the variables class size and student achievement are mixed at best. These attempts have typically been hindered, however, by the existence, at least, of one of four factors: (1) the use of a student/teacher ratio as the measure of class size resulting in measurement error; (2) the estimation of a mis-specified model resulting from the failure to control for family effects (i.e., student innate ability); (3) the general failure to take into account the endogeneity of class size with respect to student achievement; and (4) the employment of an incorrect functional form when specifying the relationship between class size and student achievement. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of class size on student achievement, unhindered by the existence of the four factors typically associated with prior attempts. The results of this reinvestigation suggest that the relationship between class size and student achievement is not only non-linear, but non-monotonic.

AB  - Using richly detailed data on fourth-and fifth-grade students in the North Carolina public school system, I find evidence that students are assigned to classrooms in a non-random manner based on observable characteristics for a substantial portion of classrooms. Moreover, I find that this non-random assignment is statistically related to class size for a number of student characteristics and that failure to control for classroom composition can severely bias traditionally estimated class size effects. Teacher-fixed effects and classroom composition controls appear to be effective at addressing selection related to classroom composition. I find heterogeneity in class size effects by student characteristics -- students who struggle in school appear to benefit more from class size reductions than students in the top of the achievement distribution. I find that smaller classes have smaller achievement gaps on average and that class size reductions may be relatively more effective at closing achievement gaps than raising average achievement; however, class size effects on both average achievement and achievement gaps are small.

A causal model linking student, school, and teacher background information; class size, teaching practices, and mean class mathematics achievement was developed. The teaching practices that varied for classes of different size and that linked class size and mathematics achievement involved class grouping, the number and type of interactions among teacher and students, teacher questioning, homework practices, and management of classroom noise.

AB  - This article uses a feature of the French system in which some novice teachers start their jobs before receiving any training. Moreover, thanks to administrative mistakes in forecasting the number of teachers, trained and untrained novice teachers are similar in 1991. We show that they are assigned to similar classes. In addition, we show that the same sample can be used to estimate the causal effect of class size. Our findings are: (1) teachers' training substantially improves students' test scores in mathematics, except for initially low-achieving students; (2) a small class is beneficial to students, especially to low-achieving ones.

After controlling for other factors and misreporting error, I find that large classes have substantial adverse effects on student achievement. Increases in class size from 19 to 60 students reduce test scores by about 80 points, or two points for each additional student in the class. It seems likely that this estimate measures the cumulative effect of class size in grades one to four

AB  - We employ a regression-discontinuity design to identify effects on educational attainment after compulsory school of class size and the number of pupils per weekly teacher hour using administrative rules as instruments. We use Danish administrative panel data. Average class size is 20, about the same as in the US and most European countries. Restricting the sample to observations close to the enrolment discontinuity points where the administrative rules have greatest predictive power, instrumental variables estimates are consistently negative. Estimates from the preferred specification are marginally significant and indicate modest effects in line with earlier studies. Estimates for subgroups are less precise, but they indicate larger effects for pupils from less advantaged backgrounds

AB  - This study compared the progress in reading and spelling of 256 children in 11 classes in 9 English primary schools in Years 3 and 4, and a partially overlapping sample of 126 children who received additional help with literacy during 1 year. Teachers and teaching assistants used either Additional Literacy Support (ALS), a highly structured set of small group teaching materials devised by the English National Literacy Strategy, or a wide variety of other materials including other published intervention programmes, reading scheme-based, computer-based and individually designed interventions, or a combination of ALS and other interventions. The influence of a broad range of contextual factors were investigated, especially whether children's qualities, school factors such as socioeconomic status and class size, and delivery differences made significant differences to the outcomes of the different interventions. The study used a naturalistic quasi-experimental design, in which teachers were asked to record details of their children and interventions without altering their professional decisions, which has not been used before in investigating literacy difficulties in context. ALS was marginally more effective than other interventions in the majority of classes, but was clearly superior in value for money terms. Children's qualities did not appear to affect outcomes. Although children receiving additional help made better than average progress, overall catch-up was limited, especially in spelling. (Contains 8 tables.)

Current research on primary and secondary education concludes that smaller class sizes and smaller schools can have a significant positive impact on learning. This appears true regardless of how much money is spent on education, which is a good thing, because with few exceptions there is not as much money available to build schools as there once was

AB  - In this study relationships between class size and 688 first grade students' academic achievement in reading, listening, and mathematics were examined in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school years. Achievement test scores of 338 children in classes of 20 children each in l987-88 were compared with test data of 350 first grade children in classes of 27 students each during the 1986-87 school year. The Stanford Achievement Test Battery, Primary 1, was administered in April in the course of the routine testing program for each of the two years. Test data reported by the test's publishers were employed as criterion variables in the study. Variables of gender, race, and class size were recorded from official class records. Eligibility for federal free lunch programs was the criterion used to evaluate socioeconomic status. Multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance statistics were used to analyze achievement differences. Results indicated that, compared to students taught in the larger group, the first graders taught in groups of 20 attained significantly higher total and subscale scores in word study skills, word reading, reading comprehension, vocabulary, listening comprehension, spelling, concept of numbers, mathematics applications, environment, and reading. No differences in achievement were associated with gender, race, or socioeconomic status in any of the areas tested. (RH)

AB  - This paper compares the achievement of first and second grade students in reduced size classrooms with the achievement of previous groups taught in larger classrooms in a Mississippi community. It also examines a longitudinal class size effect through the analysis of student achievement for two years. The subjects involved in the study were 371 first grade students and 309 second grade students grouped in heterogeneous classes of no more than 20 students during the 1988-89 school term. These groups were taught by a teacher and assistant teacher team and used the curriculum adopted by the school district. The same instructional materials were employed during the two-year research period. Data was also collected from 350 first graders taught during 1986-87 and from 313 second graders taught during 1987-88 in homogeneous classrooms of 27 students. The Stanford Achievement Test battery, Primary 1, was administered to the students to compare achievement. Significant differences in achievement in total reading, total mathematics, and total listening were found favoring the students who were taught in small classes. (RJC)

AB  - There is on-going concern about the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their first years of schooling. The Institute of Education's class size project was set up to address this issue and began recruiting in the autumn of 1996. However, because of the non-normality of achievement measures, especially in mathematics, the results have hitherto been presented by using transformed achievement measures. This makes the interpretation difficult for non-statisticians. Ideally, the data would be modelled on the original scale and a bootstrap procedure used to ensure that inferences are robust to non-normality. However, the data are multilevel. In the paper we therefore propose a nonparametric residual bootstrap procedure that is suitable for multilevel models, show that it is consistent and present a simulation study which demonstrates its potential to yield substantial reductions in the difference between nominal and actual confidence interval coverage, compared with a parametric bootstrap, when the underlying distribution of the data is non-normal. We then apply our approach to estimate the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their reception year, after adjusting for other possible determinants.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of a mandatory attendance policy on student grades. Data collected from 301 students in microeconomics principles classes taught by the same instructor are used to estimate performance. The empirical analysis controls for the endogeneity of attendance rates and class size. Results indicate that GPA prior to taking the course and SAT scores are consistent predictors of student performance, even after accounting for student withdrawals. In addition, attendance rates are not found to be significant indicators of exam grades after accounting for simultaneity. Since class size and the attendance policy do not appear to influence grades, it is suggested that instructors encourage, but not mandate attendance in both small and large lecture settings

AB  - Many studies have shown the benefits of smaller class sizes--including random experiments like the Student Teacher Achievement Ratio Project conducted in 79 elementary schools in Tennessee, which assigned children to either small or regular-size classes, as well as large-scale analyses of small and large classrooms that have occurred naturally. Although researchers may quibble over the exact magnitude of gains associated with smaller classes--or the means by which small classes bring about such gains--few of them disagree with the basic fact that smaller classes result in higher average achievement. By reducing elementary-school classes from 23 students to 15, achievement, as measured by standardized exams like the Stanford Achievement Test, increases about 7 percent on average. And the longer students are in smaller classes, the greater their achievement gain is. In this article, the authors contend that smaller classes could actually widen the achievement gap between haves and have-nots

AB  - This quantitative study was designed to investigate if there was differences among the following groups: (1) school size, (2) class size, (3) ethnicity, (4) gender, and (5) a teacher's years of experience with respect to fifth grade TAKS math and reading scores when controlling for low socio-economic status for 1404 students at elementary campuses in district A. Fifth grade students participating in high stakes tests in Texas was not achieving at the same academic levels and risk failure of promotion to grade six, a prerequisite for future educational, social, and economic success. A review of the literature indicated that some variables impacted and contributed to the academic success or failure of students more than others. This study addressed these questions. Study findings suggested the following conclusions about student performance on TAKS in district A. African American achievement scores were lower than all other subgroups. Student achievement performances did vary by school and class size. Achievement differences between genders were not significant, with exception of the African American male and female scores. African American females outperformed African American males in both math and reading performances. Teacher years of experience impacted student performance but not as significantly as reading performance impacted math achievement. This study has implications for further research and educational practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In Project STAR, 11,571 students in Tennessee and their teachers were randomly assigned to classrooms within their schools from kindergarten to third grade. This article evaluates the long-term impacts of STAR by linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first demonstrate that kindergarten test scores are highly correlated with outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home ownership, and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental impacts. First, students in small classes are significantly more likely to attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes. Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K�_"3�_"as measured by classmates' end-of-class test scores�_"have higher earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of class quality fade out on test scores in later grades, but gains in noncognitive measures persist

AB  - Abstract: Class-size reduction (CSR) mandates presuppose that resources provided to reduce class size will have a larger impact on student outcomes than resources that districts can spend as they see fit. I estimate the impact of Florida''s statewide CSR policy by comparing the deviations from prior achievement trends in districts that were required to reduce class size to deviations from prior trends in districts that received equivalent resources but were not required to reduce class size. I use the same comparative interrupted time series design to compare schools that were differentially affected by the policy (in terms of whether they had to reduce class size) but that did not receive equal additional resources. The results from both the district- and school-level analyses indicate that mandated CSR in Florida had little, if any, effect on student achievement.

AB  - Schools across the United States are facing budgetary pressures on a scale not seen in generations. Times of fiscal exigency force policymakers and education practitioners to pay more attention to the return on various categories of public investment in education. The sizes of the classes in which students are educated are often a focus of these discussions because they are a key determinant of educational spending. The declines in funding currently faced by many schools mean that cuts must be made, but it is often unclear how to make cuts in ways that minimize harm to students. This article reviews the evidence base available to inform such policy decisions. It divides the review of the high-quality evidence on class size into three sections. First, it discusses the Tennessee STAR experiment, which is the most important and influential study because it is the only modern randomized experiment conducted at a significant scale. Second, it reviews the quasi-experimental evidence based on naturally occurring variation in class size that is credibly exogenous to student achievement. Finally, it reviews the quasi-experimental evaluations of two statewide class-size reduction policies. These studies are examined separately because in addition to offering evidence about class size, they also raise important issues related to the design and implementation of class-size policies.

AB  - Abstract: Many U.S. states and cities spend substantial funds to reduce class size, especially in elementary (primary) school. Estimating the impact of class size on learning is complicated, since children in small and large classes differ in many observed and unobserved ways. This paper uses a method of to assess the impact of class size on the test scores of grade 3 and 5 students in Minnesota. The method exploits random variation in class size due to random variation in births in school and district catchment areas. The results show that reducing class size increases mathematics and reading test scores in Minnesota. Yet these impacts are very small; a decrease of ten students would increase test scores by only 0.04–0.05 standard deviations (of the distribution of test scores). Thus class size reductions are unlikely to lead to sizeable increases in student learning.

AB  - This paper proposes an econometric framework to consistently estimate the average partial effects (APE) of school inputs on academic achievement when students are ran- domly assigned to schools within each school district but endogenously sort across school districts. We illustrate our method by estimating the APE of single-sex schooling and class size on standardized test scores using data from Seoul, Korea in 2008–2009. Our APE estimates are smaller than the estimates from conventional linear regressions with school district fixed effects, which ignore endogenous district choice and thus suffer from selection bias.

AB  - Few attempts have been made to examine the influence of student and school factors on academic achievement of youth in West Africa. We examined student- and school-level predictors of academic achievement of Ghanaian junior high school students. Age, gender, academic self-efficacy, and commitment to school are significantly associated with math and English scores. Class size and the presence of toilet facility are significant predictors of English scores. Given the long-standing debate of whether student characteristics or school resources have larger effects on academic achievement, this study presents evidence on the importance of student characteristics on Ghanaian youth's academic achievement.

The teaching practices are specifically concerned with the way the teachers supported and encouraged students' activities during verbal interactions. Two different populations were observed: classes of first year students with a reduced teacher-student ratio (about ten students per class) and classes with a normal teacher-student ratio (between 20 and 25 students per class). We found that the average level of student achievement in the reduced size classes was higher than in the standard size classes but that teaching practices differed only at precise periods of group or individual introduction to new reading texts. In these periods, we found links between teaching practices and student achievement.

AB  - We study how class size and class composition affect the academic and labor market performance of college students, two crucial policy questions given the secular increase in college enrollment. Our identification strategy relies on the random assignment of students to teaching classes. We find that a one standard deviation increase in class-size results in a 0.1 standard deviation deterioration of the average grade. Further, the effect is heterogeneous as it is stronger for males and lower income students. Also, the effects of class composition in terms of gender and ability appear to be inverse U-shaped. Finally, a reduction of 20 students (one standard deviation) in one's class size has a positive effect on monthly wages of about 80 Euros (115 USD) or 6% over the average.

AB  - Class size proponents draw heavily on the results from Project STAR to support their initiatives. Adding to the political appeal of these initiative are reports that minority and economic disadvantaged students receive the largest benefits. To explore and truly understand the heterogeneous impacts of class size and student achievement requires more flexible estimation approaches. We consider several semi and nonparametric strategies and find strong evidence that i) higher ability students gain the most from class size reductions while many low ability students do not benefit from these reductions, ii) there are no significant benefits in reducing class size from 22 to 15 students in any subject area, iii) no additional benefits from class size reductions for minority or disadvantaged students, iv) significant heterogeneity in the effectiveness of class size reductions across schools and in parental and school behavioural responses.

AB  - Using a rich individual-level dataset on secondary public schools in Israel, we find strong evidence for discontinuities in the relationship between enrollment and household characteristics at cutoff points induced by a maximum class size rule. Our findings extend existing work that documents such discontinuities only among private schools (Urquiola and Verhoogen, 2009). These discontinuities violate the assumptions underlying the regression discontinuity design, which are crucial for identification. Consequently, IV estimates of class size effects are likely to be seriously biased. Potential manipulation of the treatment assignment rule by public schools warrants caution in applying a regression discontinuity design to estimate class size effects and indicates that institutional context is crucial for its scope of applicability.

AB  - Class size reduction has been viewed as one school mechanism that can improve student achievement. Nonetheless, the literature has reported mixed findings about class size effects. We used 4th- and 8th-grade data from TIMSS 2003 and 2007 to examine the association between class size and mathematics achievement in public schools in Cyprus. We employ instrumental variables methods, and take advantage of a regression discontinuity design to examine causal effects of class size on mathematics achievement. The results indicate a non-significant relationship between class size and mathematics achievement in 8th grades. However, there is evidence of positive class size effects in 4th grade. The gender gap is significant and favoured males in 4th grade and females in 8th grade. SES indexes such as parental education and items in the home are positively and significantly related to mathematics achievement. Teacher and school variables are not significantly related with mathematics achievement.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of class size on the decision to stay on in full time schooling at the age of 16 and on wages at later stages in life. Little research exists on the effect of school quality on career decisions, although it has potentially important long term implications. We use micro data for England and Wales that contain an unusually rich set of variables on parental background and previous achievements. We find that class size, measured as the pupil-teacher ratio at the school level, has a sizeable and significant effect on the decision to remain in full time education beyond the minimum age. This finding is very robust and persists when school type variables, exam results, and results from past ability tests are controlled for. We also estimate wage equations including the staying on decision at age 16 as one of the explanatory variables. The effect of staying on is significantly positive for wages at age 33 and age 42, and for females also at age 23. Combining this effect with the effect of class size on the staying on decision, our results reveal that class size significantly affects future wages. Reduced form models in which wages are directly regressed on class size lead to much less accurate and generally insignificant estimates.

AB  - In many transition countries, including Ukraine, decreases in population and fertility have led to substantial falls in the number of school-aged children. As a consequence, these countries now have school networks that consist of many small schools, leading many countries to consider reorganizing their networks by closing smaller schools and reallocating students. Using a rich data-set of almost the entire population of Ukrainian secondary schools, we estimate the effect of school size and class size on the performance of secondary schools on Ukraine's External Independent Test. We find that larger schools tend to have somewhat better performance, both in terms of test scores and in terms of test participation. The size of this effect is relatively small, however, especially in rural areas for which the estimates are likely to be less biased. Class size is found to be insignificant in most specifications and, if significant, of negligible size. The importance of this finding for the "rationalization" of the large school networks in Eastern Europe is discussed.

AB  - We employ a regression-discontinuity design to identify effects on educational attainment (years of education) of class size and the number of pupils per weekly teacher hour using administrative rules as instruments. We use a Danish administrative panel data set based on a 10% random sample of eight cohorts of pupils (and their parents). Restricting the sample to observations close to enrollment discontinuity points, instrumental variables estimates are consistently negative. Although the estimates are not very precisely determined, the point estimates indicate rather large positive effects of reducing class size, and especially of reducing the number of pupils per teacher hour.

AB  - We employ a combination of school fixed effects and IV estimation to estimate the effect of class size on student performance in 18 countries. Using the random part of the class-size variation between two adjacent grades within individual schools allows us to identify causal class-size effects. Conventional estimates of class-size effects are shown to be severely biased in most school systems by within- and between-school sorting of students. Differences in our estimates across countries suggest that it is misleading to generalize results from one school system to others. While we find sizable beneficial effects of smaller classes in Greece and Iceland, the possibility of even small effects is rejected in Japan and Singapore. In 11 countries, we rule out large class-size effects. The existence of class-size effects, and the lack thereof, in different school systems appears to be related to the relative quality of the teaching force.

AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on the effectiveness of schools. The analysis is unique in five respects. First, the data employed include the minutes of instruction per five day week in each of four subjects for all the public schools in Illinois. Few education production function papers have any information on the amount of instruction students receive in a given subject. Second, the theory section of the paper argues that class size should interact with student, teacher, and school characteristics as well as with the instructional times. The empirical analysis tests this hypothesis. Third, the interactions show that the small marginal effects of class size or of teacher qualifications may result because the harm of larger class sizes is undone by better trained personnel, and the benefits of better trained teachers is undone by large class sizes. Fourth, the data span three years enabling the use of panel data techniques. Individual school specific effects are estimated and found to be strongly significant. Moreover, in the presence of these effects, class size always has the theoretically predicted sign and is highly significant. Fifth, the time series aspect of the data allows for tests of the comparability of test scores over time. If the test scores are to be compared over time as a guide to school performance and improvement, then those scores should not differ significantly over time. The results reveal that year to year differences can be substantial and statistically significant

AB  - Abstract: This paper adopts the technique of [DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996). Labour market institutions and the distribution of wages 1973–1992: A semiparametric approach. Econometrica, 64(5), 1001–1044.] to decompose differences in the distribution of PISA reading scores in Canada, and assesses the relative contribution of differences in the distribution of “class size” and time-in-term, other school factors and student background factors. Class size and time-in-term are both important school choice variables and we examine how provincial achievement differences would change if the Alberta distribution of class size and time-in-term prevailed in the other provinces. Results differ by province, and for provinces where mean achievement gaps would be lower, not all students would benefit.

AB  - Although findings on the positive effects of early childhood development programs have been widely disseminated, less attention has been given to program impacts across the entire period of early childhood. This review summarizes evidence on the effects and cost-effectiveness of programs and services from ages 3 to 9. The major focus is preschool programs for 3- and 4-year-olds, full-day kindergarten, school-age programs including reduced class sizes, and preschool-to-third-grade interventions. Participation in preschool programs was found to have relatively large and enduring effects on school achievement and child well-being. High-quality programs for children at risk produce strong economic returns ranging from about $4 per dollar invested to over $10 per dollar invested. Relative to half-day kindergarten, the positive effects of full-day kindergarten have been found to be relatively small and generally do not last for more than a year. Although no formal economic analyses have been conducted, the economic return per dollar invested would be expected to be close to zero. Among early-school-age programs, preschool plus school-age interventions (PK-3) for children at risk are linked to higher levels of school performance into adolescence. The Child-Parent Center PK-3 Program shows a return of $6 to $9 per dollar invested. Class-size reductions show evidence of positive effects, with economic returns of roughly $3 per dollar invested. The causal mechanisms of long-term effects are discussed. Key principles to promote intervention effectiveness are offered

AB  - The search for the best educational environment, especially in terms of class size, is an important educational issue for parents, teachers, administrators, and government officials. Parents and educators argue that smaller class size leads to more effective teaching and improved learning for students. Government officials argue that substantial reductions in class size are too costly and not effective. A review of the literature regarding small class size, defined as 14-25 students per class, found that researchers disagree on the findings of these studies, and that evidence regarding the benefits of small class size was inconclusive. This study sought to determine the effect of small class size on the reading achievement of first grade participating students. The population studied consisted of 88 first grade students at a Chicago public school, instructed in either a small class of 17 students or a large class of 27 students. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills was used to assess reading achievement of the students in each class. Results indicated that those students in the small class made greater gains in reading achievement compared to those in the larger class Contains 14 references. (SD)

AB  - Using a rich data set of almost the entire population of Ukrainian secondary schools, the authors estimate the effect of school size and class size on the performance of secondary schools on Ukraine's External Independent Test. They find that larger schools tend to have somewhat better performance, both in terms of test scores and in terms of test participation. The size of this effect is relatively small, however, especially in rural areas for which the estimates are likely to be more clean estimates. Class size is found to be insignificant in most specifications and, if significant, of negligible size.

AB  - In many transition countries, including Ukraine, decreases in population and fertility have led to substantial falls in the number of school-aged children. As a consequence, these countries now have school networks that consist of many small schools, leading many countries to consider reorganizing their networks by closing smaller schools and reallocating students. Using a rich data-set of almost the entire population of Ukrainian secondary schools, we estimate the effect of school size and class size on the performance of secondary schools on Ukraine's External Independent Test. We find that larger schools tend to have somewhat better performance, both in terms of test scores and in terms of test participation. The size of this effect is relatively small, however, especially in rural areas for which the estimates are likely to be less biased. Class size is found to be insignificant in most specifications and, if significant, of negligible size. The importance of this finding for the 'rationalization' of the large school networks in Eastern Europe is discussed.

AB  - This study was conducted to find out the impact of student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure on the academic achievement of students at secondary stage in Punjab (Pakistan). Student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure are very important school resource inputs. The lesser student teacher ratio and class size, and the higher per student expenditure are very effective for producing higher level of academic achievement; however, it depends upon their proper allocation among schools. Population of the study comprised all secondary and higher secondary schools, secondary teachers and secondary students in Punjab. Overall, a total of 288 schools, then 20 students and 10 teachers from each school were randomly selected as the sample of the study. The study identified the student teacher ratio and class size through school profile proforma. The longitudinal data of academic achievement in the form of aggregate marks of the annual examinations of the Classes VI, VII, & VIII as prior achievement and that of the Class X as academic achievement of the same students through “Result Sheet”. The data were summarized at school level and then analyzed collectively. Stepwise Regression analysis with linear function was used to find out the differential impact of student teacher ratio and class size on the academic achievement. The study found that there is much variation and misallocation in student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure among schools. The study found that misallocation of student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure leads to the wastage of resources and lower level of academic achievement. Reduction in student teacher ratio and class size, and addition in per student expenditure are very expensive; therefore, policy can be decided considering the funds constraints. However, allocation of student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure can be equalized within the scarce funds. This equal allocation of these resource inputs may lead to the effective use of school resource inputs and produce higher level of academic achievement.

AB  - Although recent evidence suggests that non-cognitive skills such as engagement matter for academic and economic success, there is little evidence on how key educational inputs affect the development of these skills. We present a re-analysis of follow-up data from the Project STAR class-size experiment and find evidence that early-grade class-size reductions did improve subsequent student initiative. However, these effects did not persist into the 8th grade. Furthermore, the external and, possibly, the internal validity of these inferences is compromised by non-random attrition. We also present a complementary analysis based on nationally representative survey data and a research design that relies on contemporaneous within-student and within-teacher comparisons across two academic subjects. Our results indicate that smaller classes in 8th grade lead to improvements in measures of student engagement with effect sizes ranging from 0.05 to 0.09 and smaller effects persisting two years later. Using the estimated earnings impact of these non-cognitive skills and the direct cost of a class-size reduction, the implied internal rate of return from an 8th-grade class-size reduction is 4.6 percent overall, but 7.9 percent in urban schools

AB  - The authors use nationally representative survey data and a research design that relies on contemporaneous within-student and within-teacher comparisons across two academic subjects to estimate how class size affects certain non-cognitive skills in middle school. Their results indicate that smaller eighth-grade classes are associated with improvements in several measures of school engagement, with effect sizes ranging from 0.05 to 0.09 and smaller effects persisting 2 years later. Patterns of selection on observed traits and falsification exercises suggest that these results accurately identify (or possibly understate) the causal effects of smaller classes. Given the estimated earnings impact of these non-cognitive skills, the implied internal rate of return from an eighth-grade class-size reduction is 4.6% overall, but 7.9% in urban schools.

N1  - Abstract: We study how class size and class composition affect the academic and labor market performance of college students, two crucial policy questions given the secular increase in college enrollment. Our identification strategy relies on the random assignment of students to teaching classes. We find that a one standard deviation increase in class-size results in a 0.1 standard deviation deterioration of the average grade. Further, the effect is heterogeneous as it is stronger for males and lower income students. Also, the effects of class composition in terms of gender and ability appear to be inverse U-shaped. Finally, a reduction of 20 students (one standard deviation) in one's class size has a positive effect on monthly wages of about 80 Euros (115 USD). - Abstract: or 6% over the average. - September 2010

AB  - This paper estimates the marginal effect of class size on educational attainment of high school students. We control for the potential endogeneity of class size in two ways using a conventional instrumental variable approach, based on changes in cohort size, and an alternative method where identification is based on restriction on higher moments. The data is drawn from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) collected in 2003 for the United States and the United Kingdom. Using either method or the two in conjunction leads to the conclusion that increases in class size lead to improvements in student’s mathematics scores. Only the results for the United Kingdom are statistically significant.

AB  - Using interviews with teachers and principals and a standard experimental design, this study examined the effects of class size on student achievement in mathematics and mother tongue language skills. Subjects were 610 Sri Lankan fourth graders in 18 classrooms varying in size; classrooms sizes were 20-30, 31-40, and 41-50 students. Student achievement was measured through the employment of pre- and post-tests. The instructional period was 12 weeks; teaching materials and methods were controlled across classrooms. Results showed some statistically significant differences in achievement among the different class sizes. However, these differences followed no set pattern and demonstrated no overall effects of class size on achievement. Interviews with principals and teachers suggested that differences in achievement might be more often related to a student's socioeconomic status, to possible scarcities of education resources, and to teachers' attitudes and personalities rather than to class size.

AB  - Class-size reduction (CSR) policies have typically failed to produce large achievement gains. One common explanation is that CSR forces schools to hire low-quality teachers. Prior studies of this hypothesis have been hindered by poor data. Using different data, we find that hiring quality did fall with state-wide CSR. However, this drop was temporary due to attrition by the lowest performers. Furthermore, the drop was similar for schools classified as treated and control for prior evaluations of CSR. Therefore, differences in the quality of incoming teachers cannot explain the estimated performance of CSR. This is consistent with hiring spillovers in connected markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper adopts the technique of DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) to decompose differences in the distribution of PISA test scores in Canada, and assesses the relative contribution of differences in the distribution of “class size” and time-in-term, other school factors and student background factors. Class size and time-in-term are both important school choice variables and we examine how provincial achievement differences would change if the Alberta distribution of class size and time-in-term prevailed in the other provinces. Results differ by province, and for provinces where mean achievement gaps would be lower, not all students would benefit.

Our approach is applied to the highly influential four year randomized class size study, Project STAR. We find benefits from attending small class in all cognitive subject areas in kindergarten and the first grade. We do not find any statistically significant dynamic benefits from continuous treatment versus never attending small classes following grade one. Finally, statistical tests support accounting for both selective attrition and noncompliance with treatment assignment. - August 2009

AB  - Proponents of class size reductions draw heavily on the results from Project STAR to support their initiatives. Adding to the political appeal of these initiative are reports that minority and economically disadvantaged students received the largest benefits from smaller classes. We extend this research in two directions. First, to address correlated outcomes from the same class size treatment, we account for the over-rejection of the Null hypotheses by using multiple inference procedures. Second, we conduct a more detailed examination of the heterogeneous impacts of class size reductions on measures of cognitive and noncognitive achievement using more flexible models. We find that students with higher test scores received greater benefits from class size reductions. Furthermore, we present evidence that the main effects of the small class treatment are robust to corrections for the multiple hypotheses being tested. However, these same corrections lead the differential impacts of smaller classes by race and freelunch status to become statistically insignificant.

AB  - This paper contributes to the class size literature by analysing whether short-run class size effects are constant across grade levels in compulsory school. Results are based on administrative data on all pupils enrolled in Danish public schools. Identification is based on a government-imposed class size cap that creates exogenous variation in class sizes. Significant (albeit modest) negative effects of class size increases are found for children at primary school levels. The effects on math achievement are statistically different across grade levels. Larger classes do not affect girls, non-Western immigrants and socioeconomically disadvantaged pupils more adversely than other pupils.

The instrument used is based on Dutch regulations determining the numbers of teachers as a function of school enrollment. Without instrumenting class size the effect of class size on school performance is non-negative (smaller classes are not associated with higher performance). After instrumenting class size, the effects become larger (more positive). Hence the non-negative effect of class size cannot be attributed to endogeneity bias. Next we investigate an explanation for the non-negative class size effect advanced in the social cognitive learning literature. This literature strongly suggests that pupils' achievement may benefit from a larger number of classmates with a similar level of ability. As class size reduction also reduces the expected number of classmates with similar ability, this effect may neutralize the pure class size effect. To test this idea, we repeat the analyses including the number of classmates with similar IQ as an additional regressor. The results show that this new variable has a highly significant and positive effect on school performance. In addition, inclusion of this variable reduces the class size coefficient and in most cases produces the proper negative signLast updated - 2013-09-16SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 2362 11324; 501 542 8322; 10502; 10141 11324; 4025; 12228 10919; 275 462 129

The research involved a class-size-reduction program and evaluation in primary schools in Bungoma and Butere-Mumias in Kenya. A test measuring skills students may master by end of 2nd grade was given to a sample of 10,000 students in 1st grade in March 2005. The author shares that students in tracking schools scored 0.14 standard deviations higher than those in nontracking schools

AB  - This article examines the impact of class size on literacy skills and on literacy interest in beginning readers from zones with specific educational needs in France. The data came from an experiment involving first graders in which teachers and pupils were randomly assigned to the different class types (small classes of 10-12 pupils vs. regular classes of 20-25 pupils). Globally, the findings reveal that class size has a (small) impact on the two basic literacy skills, reading (word recognition task) and spelling (word production task). Children with high literacy interest made more progress than children with low literacy interest. The analysis also explores the effect of four factors - early schooling, age, first language and socio-economic status - on the same type of literacy skills as above. Smaller classes most specifically improved performances in two types of population: children whose first language is French and children from intermediate and average socio-economic brackets. This means, in contrast, that neither the children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds nor the children whose first language was not French benefited from the use of smaller first grade classes. Data in this experiment are examined in the light of studies on the connections between class size, classroom procedures and pupils' engagement.

AB  - This paper examines evidence on the effect of class size on student achievement. First, it is shown that results of quantitative summaries of the literature, such as Hanushek (1997), depend critically on whether studies are accorded equal weight. Hanushek summarizes 277 estimates extracted from 59 published studies, and weights all estimates equally, which implicitly places more weight on some studies than others. A small number of studies, which often present estimates for several small subsamples of a larger sample, account for more than half of the estimates. Studies from which relatively many estimates were extracted tend to find negative effects of school resources, whereas the majority of studies from which relatively few estimates were extracted tend to find positive effects. When all studies in Hanushek's literature summary are given equal weight, resources are systematically related to student achievement. In addition, when studies are assigned weights in proportion to the 'impact factor' of the journal in which they were published -- a crude measure of journal quality -- class size is systematically related to achievement. When studies are given weights in proportion to their number of estimates, however, resources and achievement are not systematically related. It is argued that assigning equal weights to studies, or weights according to quality, is preferable to assigning weights according to the number of estimates extracted from the studies, because study quality is unlikely to be related to the number of estimates taken from the study, and because researcher discretion in selecting estimates is limited when studies are assigned equal weight. Second, a cost-benefit analysis of class size reduction is performed. Results of the Tennessee STAR class-size experiment suggest that the internal rate of return from reducing class size from 22 to 15 students is around 6%.

AB  - State-wide class-size reduction (CSR) policies have typically failed to produce large achievement gains. One explanation is that the introduction of such policies forces schools to hire relatively low-quality teachers. This paper uses data from an anonymous state to explore whether teacher quality suffered from the introduction of CSR. We find that it did, but not nearly enough to explain the small achievement effects of CSR. The combined fall in achievement due to hiring lower quality teachers and more inexperienced teachers is small relative to the unrealized gains. Furthermore, between-school differences in the quality of incoming teachers cannot explain the poor estimated CSR performance from previous quasi-experimental treatment-control comparisons.

AB  - Education production functions are estimated using student-level achievement data for Japanese students, with emphasis on estimating the causal effect of class size on students' academic performance. The empirical results show that studentsâ€Ÿ test scores are strongly affected by individual and family backgrounds, whereas school resource variables and teacher characteristics have a more limited impact. The causal effect of class size, which is currently being politically debated in Japan, is investigated using a regression discontinuity design. The estimation results suggest that class-size reduction has a weak impact on the academic performance of Japanese students.

AB  - The Educational Priorities Panel carried out a study of the first year of the class size reduction program for grades K-3 in the New York City public schools by visiting five schools throughout the city and interviewing the principal and at least two teachers involved in implementing the program at each school. In all, 17 interviews were conducted. This report is based on the accounts of these principals and teachers of the effects of smaller classes on their schools as well as test data from one school which indicated changes in student performance levels. On the whole, the class size reduction experience as reported by principals and teachers has been very positive. Teachers and principals have noted that students appear to learn faster and the quality of teaching appears to have been enhanced. Smaller classes allow teachers to do more frequent student evaluation and follow-up. Classroom participation and student enthusiasm appear to have increased. Fewer disciplinary referrals were made, and teacher morale improved. Some recommendations are made for strengthening the initiative, which appears to be a valuable reform and one that is focused on prevention instead of remediation. (SLD)

AB  - East Asian students regularly take top positions in international league tables of educational performance. Using internationally comparable student-level data, I estimate how family background and schooling policies affect student performance in five high-performing East Asian economies. Family background is a strong predictor of student performance in South Korea and Singapore, while Hong Kong and Thailand achieve more equalized outcomes. There is no evidence that smaller classes improve student performance in East Asia. But other schooling policies such as school autonomy over salaries and regular homework assignments are related to higher student performance in several of the considered countries.

AB  - This paper proposes a quantile regression estimator for a panel data model with interactive effects potentially correlated with the independent variables. We provide conditions under which the slope parameter estimator is asymptotically Gaussian. Monte Carlo studies are carried out to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed method in comparison with other candidate methods. We discuss an approach to testing the model specification against a competing fixed effects specification. The paper presents an empirical application of the method to study the effect of class size and class composition on educational attainment. The findings show that (i) a change in the gender composition of a class impacts differently low- and high-performing students; (ii) while smaller classes are beneficial for low performers, larger classes are beneficial for high performers; (iii) reductions in class size do not seem to impact mean and median student performance; (iv) the fixed effects specification is rejected in favor of the interactive effects specification.

AB  - This paper introduces an empirical strategy to estimate dynamic treatment effects in randomized trials that provide treatment in multiple stages and in which various noncompliance problems arise such as attrition and selective transitions between treatment and control groups. Our approach is applied to the highly influential four year randomized class size study, Project STAR. We find benefits from attending small class in all cognitive subject areas in kindergarten and the first grade. We do not find any statistically significant dynamic benefits from continuous treatment versus never attending small classes following grade one. Finally, statistical tests support accounting for both selective attrition and noncompliance with treatment assignment.

AB  - Using a rich sample of students from French junior high schools with a panel structure, we obtain small but significant and negative effects of class size on probabilities of educational success, in grades 6 and 7. An 8 to 10 student reduction of class size puts the child of a non-educated mother on an equal footing with the child of a college-educated mother. These effects vanish in grades 8 and 9. We use Angrist and Lavy's (1999) theoretical class size (i.e., "Maimonides' rule") as an instrument for observed class size. This is possible, due to availability of total high school and total grade enrollment in each year, in our exceptional data set. We control for father occupation, mother education and other variables. Using a Probit framework to model transitions from one grade to another (and thus grade repetitions), we simultaneously estimate the student's probabilities of success over 4 years in junior high school. This is done while allowing a general covariance structure of the error terms that affect latent student-performance variables and class-size auxiliary equations.

AB  - This paper estimates the effects of family background, resources, and institutions on student performance in 17 Western European school systems. Family background has a strong effect in Europe, remarkably similar in size to the United States. France and Flemish Belgium achieve the most equitable performance for students from different family backgrounds, and Britain and Germany the least. Equality of opportunities is unrelated to countries' mean performance. Quantile regressions show little variation in family-background effects across the ability distribution. There is little evidence of substantial class-size effects, but slight evidence of effects of material shortage and teacher experience in some countries. Stronger evidence exists for effects of within-country variations in schools' hiring autonomy, testing, and homework. Â

AB  - Classroom congestion and low utilization rate of classrooms are common features of secondary schools in Nigeria. They have negative impact on both secondary school teacher productivity, student learning input, and thus secondary school students academic performance. Thus study investigated the extent to which class factors like class size, student classroom-space and class utilization rate determined the performance of secondary school students in Senior Certificate Examinations (SSCE) conducted by the West Africa Examinations Council (WAEC) in Oyo State, Nigerian between 1997 and 2002 school years. The study was conducted ex post factor under a descriptive survey research design, 200 out of the 336 secondary schools in the state were randomly selected for the study. The multiple regression analysis and one-way analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. The two research hypothesis which guided the study was tested at 0.05 minimum level of significance. Findings revealed that the three lass factors (Class size, student classroom space and class utilization rate), when taken together, determined significantly secondary school students academic performance in Oyo state between 1997 and 2002. These factors, when taken separately, also determined significantly secondary school student's academic performance in the state. These findings are of great significance for educational planners, policy makers and both federal and state governments. These factors have to be taken into consideration while planning and also providing secondary education. Reprinted by permission of the [publisher Kamla-Raj Enterprises, Delhi, India]

AB  - Recently published results from the PISA 2006 Report show the existence of significant differences in performance scores among students from different Spanish regions participating in this evaluation. The aim of this paper is to use the information provided by this dataset in order to identify the causes of those divergences after controlling for educational inputs and environmental variables. For this purpose, we explicitly consider that education is a multi-input multi-output production process subject to inefficient behaviours, which can be identified at student level using a parametric stochastic distance function approach. Our findings suggest that La Rioja and Castile-Leon are the most efficient regions in Spain while Andalusia, Catalonia and the group composed of the regions that do not participate in the PISA with an extended sample are the worst. In addition, we conclude that most divergences in efficiency are attributable to students who are immigrants or repeating some course. In contrast, other factors such as class size or the type of school ownership do not seem to account for differences in students' performance

AB  - Pupils in 232 elementary-school classes in the state of Tennessee participated in a 3-yr longitudinal study of the effects of reduced class size on reading and mathematics performance. Pupils and teachers were assigned to 1 of 3 experimental conditions within each participating school: a small class with a median enrollment of 15 students, a regular class with a median enrollment of 22 students, or a regular class with a full-time teacher aide. The small-class advantage occurred originally in kindergarten and was maintained without increasing or decreasing significantly over the following 2 yrs. The impact of reduced class size was especially strong in the inner-city schools, with high minority enrollments and performance that was otherwise below that of schools in other locations.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to extend knowledge of the effects of small classes in the primary grades on pupils' academic achievement. Three questions were addressed: (1) How large are the effects of small classes relative to the number of years students participate in those classes? (2) How much does any participation in small classes in K-3 affect performance in later grades when all classes are full-size? (3) How much does the duration of participation in small classes in K-3 affect the magnitude of the benefits in later grades (4, 6, and 8)? The questions were answered using data from Tennessee's Project STAR (Student–Teacher Achievement Ratio), in which 6,300 pupils were assigned at random to small classes, full-size classes, or classes with a full-time teaching assistant. Results for question (1) indicate that both the year in which a student first enters a small class and the number of years (s)he participates in a small class are important mediators of the benefits gained. The results for questions (2) and (3) indicate that starting early and continuing in small classes for at least 3 years are necessary to assure long-term carryover effects. The results are discussed in terms of implications for class-size reduction initiatives and further research questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This investigation addressed 3 questions about the long-term effects of early school experiences: (a) Is participation in small classes in the early grades (K-3) related to high school graduation? (b) Is academic achievement in K-3 related to high school graduation? (c) if class size is related to graduation, is the relationship explained by the effect of participation in small classes on students' academic achievement? The study included 4,948 participants in Tennessee's class-size experiment, Project STAR. Analyses showed that graduating was related to K-3 achievement and that attending small classes for 3 or more years increased the likelihood of graduating from high school, especially among students eligible for free lunch. Policy and research implications are discussed.

AB  - In 2002, voters in Florida approved a constitutional amendment limiting class sizes in public schools to 18 students in the elementary grades, 22 students in middle grades, and 25 in high school grades. Analyzing statewide achievement data for school districts from 2004-2006 and for schools in 2007, this study purports to find that "mandated [class-size reduction] in Florida had little, if any, effect on cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes." The study has four flaws that, taken together, invalidate it as an evaluation of class-size reduction: 1) The data used are drawn from grades 3 and 4 to 8, where the likelihood of finding class size effects is small; 2) The differences in class sizes of two comparison groups (treated and untreated) range from about 0.5 to about 3.0 students, all too small to make a difference educationally; 3) School and district average class sizes are used in the analysis rather than the actual sizes of classes in which students were enrolled; 4) The comparison is between two sets of districts, both with small classes, differing only in whether state funding was used in a focused or general way. This study actually found that administrative discretion in spending state class-size reduction funds did not affect students' academic performance. (Contains 19 notes.)

AB  - In 1997 the Dutch Ministry started with reducing class sizes by making a supplemental budget for additional staffing available. With this investment a large amount of money was involved. Now, the question is whether this additional formation results in higher pupil achievement and consequently, when this is the case, how such an effect can be explained. This research studied the effects of additional formation within 46 Dutch primary schools. Within these schools pupils of Grade 1 were tested. Also, their interactions with the teacher and the amount of time they spent on task were observed. Results show that the pupil-teacher ratio had a positive influence on language achievement, contrary to class size and pupil-adult ratio. Pupil-teacher interactions and time on task seemed to play a, modest, role in explaining this relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)

AB  - This paper addresses the relationship between class size and student-teacher interactions as an explanation for effects of class size on achievement. Observations were conducted in kindergarten and Grade 1 classes from 46 Dutch primary schools in order to address the effect of class size on the amount and type of student-teacher interactions. The relationship between these interactions and class size was negative: more student-teacher interactions of all types occurred in smaller classes. Furthermore, the effect of smaller class size is similar for all students, regardless of their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - A policy change is used to estimate the effect of teacher density on student performance. We find that an increase in teacher density has a positive effect on student achievement. The baseline estimateobtained by using the grade-point average as the outcome variableimplies that resource increases corresponding to the class-size reduction in the STAR experiment (a reduction of seven students) improves performance by 2.6 percentile ranks (or 0.08 standard deviations). When we used test-score data for men, potentially a more objective measure of student performance, the effect of resources appears to be twice as large

Smaller classes in the last three years of primary school (age 10 to 13) are not only beneficial for cognitive test scores at age 13 but also for non-cognitive scores at that age, for cognitive test scores at ages 16 and 18, and for completed education and wages at age 27 to 42. The estimated effect on wages is much larger than any indirect (imputed) estimate of the wage effect, and is large enough to pass a cost-benefit test.

AB  - Abstract: Because classroom size reduction (CSR) and standards based testing were implemented at the same time in California during the mid-1990s, it is difficult to isolate the effects of classroom size on outcomes from the effects of curriculum changes. As a result, the main comparison in this paper is very specific – the effect of reduced sized kindergarten classrooms on test performance in second grade. The main result of the paper is that the effect of classroom size reduction is small, especially when compared to the other determinants of student achievement at the second grade level. There is a very small effect of classroom size reduction on student achievement in reading and math, and no effect in language and spelling. Of the two offsetting effects of CSR controlling for spending – the direct effect of smaller classes and the indirect effect on teacher quality, the class-size effect is larger. Over time, the negative effect on teacher quality is reduced as new teachers gain experience and credentials.

AB  - Abstract: In a four-year study of the effect of class size on pupil outcomes in a sample of 36 primary schools in Hong Kong, it has been found that there are few positive differences in attainment between classes set at less than 25 pupils and those of normal size averaging 38. Three cohorts of pupils were studied. In Cohort 1 pupils spent 3 years in small classes (from P1 to P3) while in Cohort 2 they spent two years (P1 and P2) before reverting to normal size in P3. Cohort 3 began in normal classes in P1 and continued to do so in the following P2 year. A series of multi-level models have been used to explore the effect on academic performance. Four different analyses are presented. In the first, pupils who spent three years in a normal class were compared with pupils from the same schools who spent two years in a small class before reverting to a normal class in Primary 3. The second analysis compared pupils in their third year of small class teaching with those in the same age group in normal classes. In the third comparison being in a small class for two years was compared with being in a normal class for a similar period The final comparison was between being in a small class for 3 years and being in a small class for only two years before reverting to a normal class in P3. Overall, the analysis showed no significant, consistent average effect either against sustained small class teaching or for it. However, in some schools remaining in small classes for three years led to a gain in attainment. The corollary to this is that for a similar number of schools there was a negative gain when classes return to normal in the third year of primary school. In all analyses boys tended to perform less well than girls. Motivation towards the study of Chinese, English and mathematics was always positively associated with attainment.

AB  - The impacts of school resources on student achievement have been debated for half a century with no consensus reached among scholars. This topic has received increasing attention under the backdrop of both the educational accountability movement and the economic downturn of recent years. Using student and school-level longitudinal datasets from Florida, this study examines the impacts of school resources on student achievement in math. The study also examines whether and how the impacts of school resources vary for students with different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether the marginal effects of school inputs diminish with input levels. Overall, this study does not find consistent evidence showing a causal relation between added school expenditure and student achievement in math within school-and-principals. However, the results indicate that differences in per student expenditures are statistically related to differences in student achievement in math across schools and principals at the elementary and middle school levels. Since these correlations may stem from the impacts of unobserved characteristics of students, schools and principals, further investigations are necessary to make firm conclusions. This study calls more attention to the way current resources are used. More specifically, neither a reduction in class size nor an increase in average years of teacher experience may improve student academic performance. However, an increase in the percentages of teachers with advanced degrees may raise student achievement in math at the elementary and high school levels. The percentages of classes being taught by in-field teachers also matters for student achievement at high school level. This study also indicates that the impacts of per student expenditure and class size may vary for students with different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, thus more attention should to be given to the special needs of these disadvantaged groups. However, since some conditional funding programs are not considered in this study, further investigations need to be conducted for more definitive conclusions.

AB  - Using a rich sample of students from French junior high schools with a panel structure, we obtain small but significant and negative effects of class size on probabilities of educational success, in grades 6 and 7. An 8 to 10 student reduction of class size puts the child of a non-educated mother on an equal footing with the child of a college-educated mother. These effects vanish in grades 8 and 9. We use Angrist and Lavy's (1999) theoretical class size (i.e., "Maimonides' rule") as an instrument for observed class size. This is possible, due to availability of total high school and total grade enrollment in each year, in our exceptional data set. We control for father occupation, mother education and other variables. Using a Probit framework to model transitions from one grade to another (and thus grade repetitions), we simultaneously estimate the student's probabilities of success over 4 years in junior high school. This is done while allowing a general covariance structure of the error terms that affect latent student-performance variables and class-size auxiliary equations

AB  - ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: En utilisant un riche +�chantillon d'+�l+�ves des coll+�ges d'enseignement secondaire publics fran+�ais (le panel de la DPD, du minist+�re de l'+�ducation Nationale) on obtient des effets faibles mais n+�gatifs et significatifs de la taille des classes sur les probabilit+�s de passage en classe sup+�rieure, en sixi+�me et en cinqui+�me. En classe de sixi+�me, une r+�duction de la taille de la classe de 10 +�l+�ves mettrait l'enfant d'un ouvrier sur un pied d'+�galit+� avec l'enfant d'un cadre. Ces effets disparaissent en quatri+�me et en troisi+�me. La -� r+�gle de Malmonide -+, introduite par ANGRIST et LAVY (1999) et qui repose sur les discontinuit+�s de la taille des classes r+�sultant de l'application des seuils d'ouverture de nouvelles classes, ne donne pas de tr+�s bons r+�sultats avec nos donn+�es, en d+�pit d'une forte significativit+� dans les r+�gressions dites -� de premi+�re +�tape -+. Nous montrons qu'une approche un peu diff+�rente, fond+�e sur les variations al+�atoires de l'effectif du niveau, conditionnellement +� l'effectif du coll+�ge, donne des r+�sultats bien meilleurs. En utilisant ensuite un mod+�le combinant des r+�gressions de type Probit pour d+�crire les transitions entre classes (et donc les redoublements), on estime simultan+�ment les probabilit+�s de succ+�s des +�l+�ves +� la fin de chacune des quatre ann+�es de coll+�ge. Le mod+�le +� +�quations simultan+�es que nous constraisons permet l'estimation d'une structure de covariance g+�n+�rale entre les termes d'erreurs affectant les performances des +�l+�ves et la taille des classes qu'ils ont fr+�quent+�es, mettant en +�vidence la nature endog+�ne de la taille des classes. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Using a rich sample of students from French junior high schools with a panel structure, we obtain small but significant and negative effects of class size on probabilities of being promoted to the next grade, in grades 6 and 7. In grade 6 a 10-student reduction in class size would put the child of a blue collar worker on an equal footing with the child of an educated professional. These effects vanish in grades 8 and 9. ANGRIST and LAVY's [1999] `Maimonides' rule', inducing a regression discontinuity based on class opening thresholds, doesn't work well with our data, in spite of being strong in the first-stage regression. We show that an approach based on the random variations of total grade enrollment, conditional on total school enrollment gives substantially better results. This is possible since actual class size, total grade and total school enrollment are available in our exceptional data set. Using a Probit framework to model transitions from one grade to another (and thus grade repetitions), we then simultaneously estimate the student's probabilities of success over 4 years in junior high school. The simultaneous equation model allows for the estimation of a general covariance structure of the error terms affecting latent student performance and class-size equations, which sheds light on the endogeneity of class-size.

AB  - This paper examines the causal link that runs from classroom quality to student achievement using data on twin pairs who entered the same school but were allocated to different classrooms in an exogenous way. In particular, we apply twin fixed-effects estimation to assess the effect of teacher quality on student test scores from second through eighth grade of primary education, arguing that a change in teacher quality is probably the most important classroom intervention within a twin context. In a series of estimations using measurable teacher characteristics, we find that (a) the test performance of all students improves with teacher experience; (b) teacher experience also matters for student performance after the initial years in the profession; (c) the teacher experience effect is most prominent in earlier grades; (d) the teacher experience effects are robust to the inclusion of other classroom quality measures, such as peer group composition and class size; and (e) an increase in teacher experience also matters for career stages with less labor market mobility, which suggests positive returns to on-the-job learning of teachers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of reduced class size on achievement in the primary grades. Scores on a variety of tests were used to compare the achievement of groups of primary students who had been enrolled in Indiana's Project Primetime with the achievement of cohort groups who had received instruction in larger classes prior to the implementation of the Primetime project. Tests focused on basic skills, competence, self-concept, and attitude toward school. Significant differences favoring the smaller classes were found for local skills tests, the affective measures, and all Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores for grades 1 and 2. In grade 3, however, the math subtest of the ITBS was the only one of six subtests that showed significant differences favoring the smaller classes. For the grade 3 Indiana Competency Test, there were no significant differences favoring either group. Grades 1 and 2 showed a decrease in recent years compared to the dramatic gains made during the first years of the study. It is concluded that findings demonstrate the initial impact of state sponsored class size programs, but raise questions concerning the long-term effectiveness of state supported, reduced class size programs, particularly after the novelty of smaller classes has subsided. References and 25 data tables are included. (RH)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of reducing the size of first grade classes on students' achievement. Four groups of first grade students who had participated in Indiana's Project PRIME TIME (average class size of l8 or fewer) for 1 year were compared to one class of first grade students who had received first grade instruction in larger classes. Both groups were from the same Indiana school system. The following kinds of test scores were used as the basis for comparison: (1) achievement scores that all students had received on local competency tests in mathematics and reading; and (2) scores received on affective measures of self-concept and attitude toward school. These tests were administered to the students at the end of their respective first grade years. The school year for the larger class group was 1983-84. The school years for the smaller PRIME TIME classes were 1984-85, 1985-86, 1986-87, and 1987-88. When the means of PRIME TIME group achievement and attitudes were compared to the means of the larger class group (non-PRIME TIME), the results showed that there were significant differences in all areas compared. All favored PRIME TIME. Furthermore, the means of PRIME TIME classes of recent school years were generally significantly higher than the means of PRIME TIME classes of earlier years. (RH)

AB  - The federal Class Size Reduction Program, first implemented in California's Los Angeles Unified School District in 1999-2000, included a component targeting eighth grade language arts classrooms for mandatory reduction to a minimum of 20 students per classroom. Implementation evaluation showed that average class size was below 20. This study examined levels of instructional feedback quality, discussion quality, and student-centered learning in a sample of middle school classrooms. Teachers described their learning goals for activities planned during the observation and how they had planned to assess the extent to which the goals had been met, then researchers observed them teaching. Data collected from 55 middle school English classes indicated that incidents of high quality instructional feedback and individualized instruction occurred in a small number of smaller classrooms and never occurred in larger classrooms. Teacher qualifications (years of experience and credential status) were unrelated to teaching practice in smaller and larger classrooms. Reduced class sizes did not directly impact the nature of teacher practice observed in these secondary classrooms, consistent with research on class size reduction in elementary classrooms. Two appendices present rubrics used to rate lesson quality in observed classrooms and to assess instructional orientation. (Contains 15 references.) (SM)

AB  - This study was conducted to identify factors that are predictive of student achievement outcomes and to analyze these factors in high-poverty schools versus low-poverty schools. Because of accountability standards implemented with the passage of No Child Left Behind, it is critical that educators determine factors that will increase student achievement most significantly. Once the most significant and most predictive variables of student achievement can be identified, stakeholders can implement policies and procedures to address those areas. In addition, instructional strategies can be employed to improve student success. The dependent variable under study was student achievement, which was dissected into two categories of communication art and math scores. The independent variables included were student attendance, class size, and highly qualified teachers. The objective of the study was to establish if a relationship existed between the independent variables and the dependent variable. In addition, a determination of how predictive these independent variables were of the dependent variable was an important aspect of the study. The sample included the entire population of mainstream 9-12 public high schools in a Midwest state. The statistical methods employed were descriptive statistics, Pearson r, p-value, coefficient of determination, and multiple regression. The analysis of the various statistical methods revealed a moderate correlation between student achievement and the independent variables of student attendance and highly qualified teachers for high-poverty schools. A significant level of correlation also existed between the below average attendance category and student achievement in both groups of high-poverty and low-poverty school settings. Additionally, attendance and teacher quality were predictive of both communication arts and math student achievement in the high poverty school setting, with attendance the most predictive. There was no significant relationship between class size and student achievement nor was it predictive of student achievement for either group of schools. The implications of the research will benefit stakeholders due to the effect significant variables have on student achievement in high-poverty schools. Stakeholders can work together to implement policies, procedures, and instructional strategies that can more effectively address the most predictive variables in order to improve student achievement. Additionally, the results are supportive of investigating and addressing the needs of high-poverty schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The effect of class size reduction on grades and retention was investigated. Class size for second and third graders in a rural school district was reduced from an average of 24 in second grade to an average of 20 students per class and an average of 25 in third grade to an average of 22 per class. The purpose was to investigate whether the provision of more instructional time between teacher and child through class size reduction would increase academic achievement and decrease pupil retention. Comparing year grade averages in mathematics and reading and comparing the retention rates to the previous year's averages and rates were the methods used to evaluate the success of this intervention. Results indicate positive gains in achievement and a reduction in the number of students retained. (Contains 1 table and 18 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Three "Lab" schools were established in 1994-1995 in Durham, North Carolina public schools solely to provide smaller classes for disadvantaged inner-city students. In addition, smaller class sizes were achieved in two additional elementary schools by "cashing in" teacher aides and other more judicious use of available funds. These two schools were used as a comparison group in a study to determine the effects of smaller class size on achievement; students matched on appropriate test scores from other Durham schools were used as a control group. Focus groups were conducted with staff and parents at the three Lab schools to find out what they thought were optimal class sizes and the advantages of smaller classes for students. Test data used to analyze the relationship between class size and academic performance at all five schools included: (1) assessments from Marie Clay's Observation Survey; (2) the Developmental Reading Assessment; and (3) North Carolina End-of-Grade Test scores. State standards call for class sizes of 23 students for K-2 grades, and 26 for grades 3-5. The average class size for the Lab schools ranged from 14 to 21 for K-2 and from 11 to 22.5 for grades 3-5. The average class size for the comparison schools ranged from 13.9 to 20-3 for K-2 grades, and from 14.3 to 20.3 for grades 3-5. When asked what class size was "just right," responses from school staff ranged from 16-21 students; in contrast parent responses ranged from 10-19. Students in Lab schools had higher test gain scores than students in the comparison and control groups for Kindergarten, and for first and fourth grades. Students in the Lab and comparison groups had higher test gain scores than students in the control groups for Kindergarten and second grade. Alternatively, students in the control group had higher gain scores than those in the Lab and comparison schools for third and fifth grades. These findings suggest that smaller class sizes produce the largest and most consistent test gains among disadvantaged children in the earlier grades (K-2). Multivariate analysis of the data indicated that although test scores varied within and across groups by grade, there was a significant increase in test scores for students in all groups and in all grades.

AB  - Examined the effects of class size on student achievement in classrooms in which teachers engaged in whole class instruction or in which students were assigned to ability groups for instruction. 791 elementary school students (55% Black, 38% White) in 26 classes completed standardized achievement tests in October and in May. Findings show that class size had a negative effect on student achievement in both kinds of classrooms. However, when student race was controlled the class size effect disappeared. In the ability-grouped classes, group size rather than class size was negatively related to achievement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Retention of students began soon after the introduction of graded elementary schools in the mid-1800s. As early as 1911, research started to show that retention failed to remedy the difficulties of academic achievement and social adjustment exposed through graded schools. Educators today have a number of options other than retention designed to help students who are not meeting grade-level standards. One of those options is enrolling students in smaller classes. Using the Project STAR database, this study examined whether class size remediates achievement scores of kindergartners and first graders once they have been retained. The study examined data on retained kindergartners and first graders to determine common demographic characteristics and school type and the effect of class size on academic achievement. Retained students' achievement scores in reading and math on the Stanford Achievement and the Basic Skills First tests were analyzed in three class sizes: small (13-17 students), regular (21-25 students), and regular with an aide. The average kindergarten and first grade retainee was poor, white, male, and attended a rural school. The study found that there was no significant difference among retainees at either grade level between or among classes. Also, class size did not remediate poor academic achievement.

AB  - Selection response of parents to low school quality, for instance large class sizes, is a major problem when estimating causal class-size effects, also in experimental and quasi-experimental studies. To address this problem a new identification strategy using within-school variation over time in the size of subject-specific classes is proposed. It provides random class-size variation and enables tests for possible selection using test scores in other subjects. Applying this approach to Danish administrative data, highly significant and substantial positive effects of reducing class size are found on examination marks in French. Effects are larger for academically weak students and for boys

AB  - We investigate the size-related features of the production function of Polish primary schools. The interplay of small schools ineffectiveness and of organizational and social difficulties appearing in large schools implies that the relationship between school size and student achievement is non-linear, with the optimal size crucially dependent on the social characteristics of the served population (such as average income per capita). Busing is found to have negative effect on performance, related to average distance of student transportation. The findings present several challenges to consolidation policies on quality ground, quite independent of the more common cost considerations.

AB  - The Augmented Staffing model of the Chicago Public Schools (Illinois) is a reduced class size, full-day program that includes almost 6,500 elementary school students served under Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The effects of this program were studied, examining the level of teacher knowledge about the program and its implementation, the achievement of the program's students, and program characteristics. Data are from the school system's overall report on Chapter 1 programs, which incorporated 660 observations, and questionnaires completed by 192 teachers in 1990, 441 in 1991, 99 in 1992, and 164 in 1993. Results suggest that reduced class size in itself is not sufficient to improve student test scores, but that achievement levels can rise when teachers employ more techniques associated with higher order thinking skills even though teachers relieved of the pressure of large classes do have an opportunity to diagnose their students' needs more carefully. Three tables present study data. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)

AB  - The purpose of this action research study was to determine whether class size was related to student achievement and behavioral issues. Data reflecting students’ behavior issues and quarterly grades were gathered. In addition, teacher and student participants were surveyed regarding their perceptions of class size and its relationship to instruction, learning, and behavior. Results indicated that the overall correlation between class size and grades (r= .109) was positive and statistically significant at the p < .01 level and the overall correlation between class size and number of BIRs (r= .065) was not statistically significant. Based on results from this study, there appears to be some relationships between class size and achievement and behavior, and awareness of these relationships could be important for educators to establish effective and cost effective programs. Further research controlling for sample characteristics such as age and ability and for course content and difficulty levels appears warranted to clarify the relationships between class size, student achievement, and behaviors in varied subject areas.

This seasonal feature of the schooling system makes it possible to control for unobservable pupil characteristics affecting both the level and change in achievement. Using Swedish data, I find that smaller classes generate higher achievement. A comparison with the results from applying the same data to the widely used value-added model is also made.

AB  - Evidence from Project STAR has suggested that on average small classes increase student achievement. However, thus far researchers have focused on computing mean differences in student achievement between smaller and larger classes. In this study I focus on the distribution of the small class effects at the school level and compute the inconsistency of the treatment effects across schools. I use data from Project STAR and estimated small class effects for each school on mathematics and reading scores from kindergarten through third grade. The results revealed that school-specific small class effects are both positive and negative and that although students benefit considerably from being in small classes in some schools, in other schools being in small classes is a disadvantage. Small class effects were inconsistent and varied significantly across schools. Full time teacher aide effects were also inconsistent across schools and in some schools students benefit considerably from being in regular classes with a full time aide, while in other schools being in these classes is a disadvantage.

AB  - I use natural population variation to identify the effects of class size and composition on student achievement. I isolate the credibly random component of population variation in each grade and school district and use this component to generate instrumental variables for class size and composition. I also exploit the discontinuous changes in class size that occur when natural population variation triggers a change in the number of classes in a grade in a school. Discontinuity-based results are both consistent and precise only when applied to within-district changes in class size and population. I find that reductions in class size from a base of 15 to 30 students have no effect on student achievement. The estimates are precise enough to identify improvements in math, reading, or writing achievement of just 3/100ths of a standard deviation. I find that the presence of black students in a class, in an of itself, has no effect on achievement. I demonstrate that estimates of the effect of racial composition that rely on between-district comparisons suffer from substantial bias. Finally, I show that more female classes perform significantly better in writing in the 4th through 8th grades and in math in the 4th grade. Comparison of the effects to average male-female differences in test scores suggest that gender composition alters classroom conduct

AB  - Wisconsin's Student Achievement Guarantee in Education (SAGE) program demonstrates that small class sizes have unclear achievement benefits and that improvements remain isolated in small populations. SAGE grants $2,000 per low income student to elementary schools agreeing to class sizes of 15 students, extended hours, a rigorous curriculum, and professional development programs. SAGE is likely to expand, despite evidence of ineffectiveness, in part because of immense political support. SAGE supporters claim reducing class size will increase teacher focus and student participation, reduce classroom problems, improve morale, and spur innovative practices. These claims are advanced despite counter evidence of weaknesses in internal review processes and issues with evaluation by outside reviewers. Research reveals limitations in SAGE effectiveness, including a minimal impact on achievement in second and third grade, particularly among African Americans, no measurable impact among non-African American students, and meager average gains. Funding increases required by current plans to expand SAGE are unwarranted given likely marginal achievement gains. (Contains 90 citations.) (TEJ)

AB  - This analysis examines teacher quality and class size, their respective effects on student performance, and the tradeoffs between the possible policy prescriptions associated with each. Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study is used to formulate estimates through OLS and random effects regression modeling to look at the effects of teacher background and class-level variables on student test scores in math, reading, and science in the tenth and twelfth grades. Using the results of this analysis, qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the relative importance of these factors in specific grades and subjects, as well as cost comparisons of different policy alternatives, are used to help reorient the current understanding of the relationship between these important educational factors. Based upon the national applicability and nuance of these results, and the significant obstacles that stand in the way of enacting the policy prescriptions this Note suggests, an argument for substituting national education reform for state-focused adequacy lawsuits and legislative initiatives based on a civic constitutional right to an education is also advanced

AB  - Other things being equal, theory would suggest that students in smaller classes at school should do better in terms of attainment; convincing experimental evidence for this also exists in the US. However, a relationship between small classes and better outcomes has not generally been evident in individual-level studies, possibly because of endogeneity arising from low-attaining or otherwise 'difficult' students being put into smaller classes than their higher-achieving counterparts. The present paper uses data from the National Child Development Study to estimate the effects of class size. Ordinary least-squares estimates indicate that small classes are not related to attainment; however, instrumental variables estimates, with class size instrumented by the interaction between school size and school type, show a significant and sizeable association between smaller classes and higher attainment in reading in the early years of school. This effect is common to different groups of students, and for some groups (girls, and those from larger families), this association is also found to persist through to age 11.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

AB  - Using student evaluations as a learning measure, we estimate and compare class size and teacher effects for higher education, with emphasis on determining whether a comprehensive class size reduction policy that draws on the hiring of new teachers is likely to improve educational outcomes. We find that teacher effects far outweigh class size effects, and that young teachers and first time teachers perform significantly worse than their peers. Furthermore, we study whether teacher effects are correlated with observables, and find no significant variables beyond being a full time teacher. Overall, these findings suggest that at the higher education level the optimal strategy is to have large classrooms with highly qualified teachers.

AB  - An Instrumental Variables (IV) identication strategy that exploits statutory class size caps shows signficant achievement gains in smaller classes in Italian primary schools. Gains from small classes are driven mainly by schools in Southern Italy, suggesting a substantial return to class size reductions for residents of the Mezzogiorno. In addition to high unemployment and other social problems, however, the Mezzogiorno is distinguished by pervasive manipulation of standardized test scores, a finding revealed in a natural experiment that randomly assigned school monitors. IV estimates also show that small classes increase score manipulation. Estimates of a causal model for achievement with two endogenous variables, class size and score manipulation, suggest that the effects of class size on measured achievement are driven entirely by the relationship between class size and manipulation. Dishonest scoring appears to be a consequence of teacher shirking more than teacher cheating. These findings show how consequential score manipulation can arise even in assessment systems with few NCLB-style accountability concerns.

AB  - This report for the 1982-83 school year summarizes the results of Project Primetime, an experimental program to improve students' basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic by reducing class size from kindergarten through the second grade. Three major results emerged from the study: (1) Students in the project scored higher on standardized tests than did students in larger classes; (2) Discipline and behavior problems were reduced in classes with lower teacher/student ratios; and (3) Teachers reported increased productivity and effectiveness in classes with fewer students. It was concluded that small class size during the early years of a child's academic development strongly enhances the quality of the child's initial educational experiences. Appendices list the nine schools participating in Project Primetime during 1981-82 and 1982-83 and enumerate the 24 school corporations and 28 school sites participating in the program during the 1983-84 and 1984-85 school years.

AB  - Studies on the effect of class size on student achievement typically find that disadvantaged students benefit more from reduced class size than others. To better understand this differential impact, we analyze changes in the learning environment due to class size, and behavioral responses to class size among parents, schools, teachers and students. The variation in class size is induced by a maximum class size rule applying to upper primary schools in Sweden. We find that in response to an increase in class size: i) teachers seem to assign more responsibility to students; ii) low-income students find their teachers hard to follow when taught in full-class iii) high-income parents help their children more with homework; iv) parents are more likely to change schools; and v) other school inputs and student effort adjust very little. These findings help explain why we find that the negative effect of class size on achievement in our data is concentrated among low-income students.

AB  - Background: Past studies have examined factors associated with reductions in bias in comparison group studies (CGSs). The companion work to this article extends the framework to investigate the accuracy of generalized inferences from CGS. Objectives: This article empirically examines levels of bias in CGS-based impact estimates when used for generalization, and reductions in bias resulting from covariate adjustment. It assesses potential for bias reduction against criteria from past studies. Research design: Multisite trials are used to generate impact estimates based on cross-site comparisons that are evaluated against site-specific experimental benchmarks. Strategies for reducing bias are evaluated. Results from two experiments are considered. Subjects: Students in Grades K-3 in 79 schools in Tennessee and students in Grades 4-8 in 82 schools in Alabama. Measures: Grades K-3 Stanford Achievement Test reading and math scores; Grades 4-8 Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) 10 reading scores. Results: Generalizing impacts to sites through estimates based on between-site nonexperimental comparisons leads to bias from differences between sites in average performance, and in impact, and covariation between these quantities. The first of these biases is larger. Covariate adjustments reduce bias but not completely. Criteria for bias reduction from past studies appear to extend to generalized inferences based on CGSs. Conclusion: When generalizing from a CGS, results may be affected by bias from differences between the study and inference sites in both average performance and average impact. The same factors may underlie both forms of bias. Researchers and practitioners can assess the validity of generalized inferences from CGSs by applying criteria for bias reduction from past studies.

AB  - Most evaluations of education policies focus on their mean impacts; when distributional effects are investigated it is usually by comparing mean impacts across demographic subgroups. We argue that such estimates may overlook important treatment effect heterogeneity; in order to appreciate the full extent of a policy's distributional impacts one should also exploit alternative methods. We demonstrate this using data from Project STAR, where we find evidence of substantial treatment effect heterogeneity across achievement quantiles. While all children appear to benefit from being placed in small classes, the largest test score gains are at the top of the achievement distribution. This result seems to be at odds with previous evidence that smaller classes benefit disadvantaged children most, but the discrepancy is reconciled by the fact that there are similar patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity within demographic groups, and that gains for disadvantaged students are larger throughout much of the achievement distribution.

AB  - A study investigated the effect of kindergarten class size on reading readiness achievement. Subjects, 2,837 kindergarten students in 38 elementary schools that serve rural, urban, suburban, and inner-city schools, participated in the first year of Project STAR (Student Teacher Academic Ratio) in 1985-86. The subjects' 140 kindergarten teachers reported data indicating mastery or non-mastery of the 25 reading readiness objectives of the Tennessee Basic Skills First program. Data were analyzed using a five-way analysis of variance and a crosstabulation procedure with a chi-square test of significance. Results indicated that: (1) small class size is significantly related to reading achievement in the total 25 tested Basic Skills and the subcategory of 20 comprehension skills; (2) the 1:15 class mastered one more objective than the 1:25 class and 0.6 more of an objective than the 1:25 plus a full-time aide class; (3) no significant relationship was found between classes of 1:15, 1:25, or 1:25 plus a full-time aide and the mastery of the five word identification skills; (4) the 1:25 class was found to be least effective in achieving reading readiness; (5) students in classes of 1:15 who attended 90 percent of the time showed the greatest gain; and (6) the lowest mean scores were received by males, blacks, free/reduced lunch, and inner city students in the 1:25 class, and the highest scores for this group were in the 1:15 class. Recommendations include mandatory kindergarten with a teacher/pupil ration of 1:15.

AB  - Abstract: In this paper we analyze class size effects in the case of primary schools in Poland. We use two empirical strategies to avoid endogeneity bias. First, we use average class size in a grade as an instrumental variable for actual class size. This allows us to control for within school selection of pupils with different abilities to classes of different sizes. Additionally, we estimate fixed effects for schools to control for differences between them. Second, we exploit the fact that there is an informal maximum class size rule. We estimate class size effect only for those enrollment levels where some schools decide to add a new class and thus dramatically lower class sizes. For such enrollment levels variance of class size is mainly exogenous and we argue that this allows estimation of quasi-experimental class size effects. In this case we again use average class size as an instrument with enrollment as a key control variable. Using both strategies we obtain similar findings. We found that the positive effects observed with OLS regression disappear when we use instrumental variables. If we avoid endogeneity bias, then class size negatively affects student achievement. However, this effect is rather small. We discuss methodology, possible bias of results and the importance of our findings to current policy issues in Poland.

AB  - Numerous studies have investigated the impact of class size on student outcomes. This analysis contributes to this discussion by isolating the impact of class size on student outcomes in higher education by utilizing a natural experiment at a selective institution which enables the estimation of class size effects conditional on the total number of students taught by a faculty member. We find that class size negatively impacts student assessments of courses and instructors. Large classes appear to prompt faculty to alter their courses in ways deleterious to students.

AB  - A substantial amount of controversy surrounds the issue of class size in public schools. Parents and teachers are on one side, touting the benefits of smaller class sizes (e.g., increased academic achievement, greater student-teacher interaction, utilization of more innovative teaching strategies, and a decrease in discipline problems). On the other side, many legislators and policymakers doubt the benefits, claiming that smaller classes produce minimal results while incurring large costs. Those who oppose decreasing class sizes believe that funds could be more wisely spent on programs that show greater benefits. This argument is framed between two opposing perspectives: accountability versus quality instruction. Policy analysts refer to accountability as a cost-benefit analysis of a program. Cost-benefit analyses are often used to examine education policy issues with a focus on school administration, finance, and leadership. Another form of analysis, experimental analysis, tests the integrity of a policy. Experimental analyses are commonly used to examine school curricular issues focusing on pedagogy and student achievement. Experimental analysis requires random assignment of subjects to experimental and control groups, a treatment for the experimental group, and an evaluation to determine which group performed better. This article addresses the feasibility of reducing class size by reviewing the literature, using experimental and cost-benefit analyses. The experimental analysis includes a review of class size studies and their application on large samples. The cost-benefit analysis examines class size policies, initiatives, and costs involved for one state--Florida

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of California's class size reduction program on teacher quality and student achievement in an effort to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of a large-scale decrease in class size. It uses year-to-year differences in class size generated by natural variation in enrollment and the state's class size reduction program to identify both the direct effects of class size reduction and accompanying changes in teacher quality. The results show that, all else equal, smaller classes raise third-grade mathematics and reading achievement, particularly for lower-income students. However, the expansion of the teaching force required to staff the additional classrooms appears to have led to a deterioration in average teacher quality in schools serving a predominantly black student body. This deterioration partially or, in some cases, fully offset the benefits of smaller classes, demonstrating the importance of considering all implications of any policy change

AB  - Intuitively, class size reduction is a good idea. Parents support it because it means that their children will receive more individual attention from teachers. Teachers like it for the same reason and also because it creates a more manageable workload. It is generally assumed that the fewer students in a class, the better they will learn and the higher they will score on nationwide tests--currently one of the most common measures of student achievement. Nevertheless, several things could go wrong with mandated class size reduction (CSR). This report presents evidence that the potential success or failure of such a reform may depend largely on how it is implemented and how teachers and administrators respond. If it is implemented quickly on a large scale, such a program may run into serious problems. Jepsen and Rivkin analyze some of the things that went right and some that did not after California passed its CSR law in 1996. The study finds that, overall, smaller classes have a greater positive effect on students in low-income schools: following CSR, test score gains in five of the state's six largest school districts were found to be larger than gains in school districts throughout the state as a whole. However, the pattern did not hold in Los Angeles, California's largest school district, where schools with predominantly low-income students saw lower test scores after class size reduction. The study suggests that this surprising finding could be related to CSR having exacerbated the shortage of qualified, experienced teachers in the poorest schools by increasing the number of inexperienced, uncertified teachers in the most at-risk schools as more senior teachers left to fill new openings in more affluent schools. The report is divided into five sections: (1) Introduction; (2) Elementary School Demographic Composition; (3) Trends in Teacher Characteristics during the 1990s; (4) CSR and Student Achievement; and (5) Summary and Policy Implications. The document alsoincludes a foreword (David W. Lyon), summary, lists of tables and figures, acknowledgments, references, author information and list of other Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) publications on education.

It uses year-to-year differences in class size generated by variation in enrollment and the state's class-size-reduction program to identify both the direct effects of smaller classes and related changes in teacher quality. Although the results show that smaller classes raised mathematics and reading achievement, they also show that the increase in the share of teachers with neither prior experience nor full certification dampened the benefits of smaller classes, particularly in schools with high shares of economically disadvantaged, minority students.

AB  - Teacher's perceptions of their experiences in teaching small classes or with a full-time teacher's aide are discussed in this report. The study reported was part of Tennessee's Project STAR: a 4-year, longitudinal demonstration policy study. Analyses were conducted on interviews with 86 teachers of small second grade classes, 54 teachers of second grade classes of regular size, and 71 teachers from second grade classes of regular size who were assisted by a full-time teacher aide. Teachers were from inner-city, suburban, urban, and rural schools. Discussion focuses on differences in: (1) amount of content covered; (2) amount of instructional time on task; (2) monitoring of pupils' work; (4) ability to match level of instruction to the ability of individual pupils; (5) pacing of instruction; (6) degree of active student-teacher academic interaction; (7) individual attention to students; (8) classroom social climate; (9) demands on available time; and (9) aspects of the use of the full-time teacher aide. Project STAR teacher interviews revealed distinct and consistent perceptions and explanations that clearly illustrated that having fewer children or an adult assistant in the classroom contributed to significant improvements in the quality of teachers' worklife, the classroom learning environment, and children's experiences in schools.

AB  - This paper offers a summary analysis of 4 years of interviews with 1,003 kindergarten and first through third grade teachers regarding their experience in teaching either a small class, a regular size class, or a regular size class with a full-time teacher's aide. The paper uses teachers' descriptions of their experience to explore the effect of reduced class size or reduced teacher/pupil ratio on developmental appropriateness of primary grade curriculum and on adult-child interaction. Current class size research is briefly sketched. The paucity of findings regarding classroom processes is noted. Next, Project STAR, a 4-year longitudinal study of effects of reduced class size and teacher/pupil ratio in kindergarten through third grades is described. Results of the teacher interviews are summarized and discussed in relation to the National Association for the Education of Young Children's position statements on developmentally appropriate practice in the primary grades. It is concluded that small classes of about 15 students and regular size classes of about 25 students and a full-time aide contribute to a primary grade experience that is more congruent with the developmental and learning needs of students than is the experience of proportionally larger classes.

AB  - Both business leaders and parents pressure policymakers to legislate new initiatives to improve schools. One improvement strategy has been to reduce class sizes; another has been to allocate larger school budgets. This paper presents findings of a study that examined the relationship between class size and student achievement and between expenditure per student and student achievement. Data from "The Factbook on Elementary, Middle, and Secondary Schools 1993" (Mattson 1993) were analyzed. The study correlated expenditures per student, student-to-teacher ratios, and mean Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores for the 50 states and the District of Columbia using a computer program that calculated Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients. The study found a small but insignificant relationship between class size and performance on the SAT, and a significant negative correlation between expenditures per student and SAT achievement. Four tables and six graphs are included. (Contains nine references.) (LMI)

AB  - In this study the authors test whether matching using intact local groups improves causal estimates over those produced using propensity score matching at the student level. Like the recent analysis of Wilde and Hollister (2007), they draw on data from Project STAR to estimate the effect of small class sizes on student achievement. They propose a strategy for intact group matching in which they match treatment cases to control cases in other schools. A secondary goal of this analysis is to determine whether the use of geographic covariates (including latitude and longitude, as well as Census variables) improve the quality of matches over the use of student, teacher, and school covariates alone. They hypothesize that by incorporating physical distance into their matching, they will increase their likelihood of finding maximally similar comparison classrooms

AB  - There is widespread agreement that schooling quality should be a priority in the post-2015 education agenda, but less agreement on how quality can be enhanced in a cost effective manner. In Uganda, classroom overcrowding is often considered a critical cause of poor learning outcomes. This paper investigates how various aspects of classroom composition, including class size and the achievement distribution of classmates, affect individual learning. Using test score data for over 250,000 children, such compositional factors are found to be relevant. However, their influence on learning is not so large as to justify major standalone policy interventions. Rather, pedagogical changes that support children with literacy difficulties merit particular consideration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The results of the t-test on class size indicated that students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in the on-going assessment whereas students in large classes performed better than students in small classes in the final exam. The T test on class ranking indicated that ‘ranking 1’ class students had consistently outperformed their counterparts in ‘ranking 2’ classes in the on-going assessment, final exam and overall achievement. Regression analysis indicated that class size, class ranking and on-going assessment contributed significantly to the prediction of students’ overall achievement

AB  - This paper investigates urban-rural and size effects on public upper secondary school efficiency in Northern Thailand. Efficiency is assessed by a nonparametric technique, namely data envelopment analysis. Urban-rural and size effects are examined through a Mann-Whitney nonparametric statistical test and by Tobit regression analysis, respectively. Results indicate that rural schools operate less efficiently than urban ones. School size contributes positively to both types of schools, while class size has a positive effect on urban schools and a negative one on rural schools. Policy to improve school efficiency should thus focus on rural schools, expanding school size while reducing class size.

AB  - Given that previous findings on the social distribution of the effects of small classes have been mixed and inconclusive, in the present study I attempted to shed light on the mechanism through which small classes affect the achievement of low- and high-achieving students. I used data from a 4-year, large-scale, randomized experiment (project STAR) to examine the effects of small classes on the achievement gap. The sample consisted of nearly 11,000 elementary school students who participated in the experiment from kindergarten to grade 3. Meta-analysis and quantile regression methods were employed to examine the effects of small classes on the achievement gap in mathematics and reading SAT scores. The results consistently indicated that higher-achieving students benefited more from being in small classes in early grades than other students. The findings also indicated that, although all types of students benefited from being in small classes, reductions in class size did not reduce the achievement gap between low and high achievers.

AB  - The findings on the social distribution of the immediate and lasting benefits of small classes have been mixed. We used data from Project STAR and the Lasting Benefits Study to examine the long-term effects of small classes on the achievement gap in mathematics, reading, and science scores (Stanford Achievement Test). The results consistently indicated that all types of students benefit more in later grades from being in small classes in early grades. These positive effects are significant through grade 8. Longer periods in small classes produced higher increases in achievement in later grades for all types of students. For certain grades, in reading and science, low achievers seem to benefit more from being in small classes for longer periods. It appears that the lasting benefits of the cumulative effects of small classes may reduce the achievement gap in reading and science in some of the later grades

AB  - Thus far researchers have focused on computing average differences in student achievement between smaller and larger classes. In this study, the author focus on the distribution of the small class effects at the school level and compute the inconsistency of the small class effects across schools. The author use data from Project STAR to estimate small class effects for each school on mathematics and reading scores from kindergarten through third grade. Then, all school estimates were combined to calculate an overall weighted average. The results revealed that a large proportion of the school-specific small class effects are positive, while a smaller proportion of the estimates are negative. Although students benefit considerably from being in small classes in many schools, in other schools being in small classes is either not beneficial or is a disadvantage. Small class effects were inconsistent and varied significantly across schools in all grades indicating a small class by school interaction.

AB  - Background/Context: The effects of class size on student achievement have gained considerable attention in education research and policy, especially over the last 30 years. Perhaps the best evidence about the effects of class size thus far has been produced from analyses of Project STAR data, a large-scale experiment where students and teachers were randomly assigned lo smaller or larger classes within schools. Researchers have also analyzed observational data to examine the effects of class size, but the results have been mixed. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: It is generally difficult to draw causal inferences about class size effects with observational data because of the omitted variables problem. This shortcoming can be overcome with instrumental variables (IV) methods that are designed to facilitate causal inferences. The present study uses IV methods to examine the effects of class size on reading achievement using data from the 2001 fourth-grade sample of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) in Greece. We look advantage of Greece's nationwide rule about maximum class size in elementary schools to construct IV estimates of class size. Population: PIRLS was designed to monitor children's achievement levels in fourth grade worldwide. We used reading achievement data from 2001 in Greece. The sample was a national probability sample of fourth graders. The use of appropriate weights helped us make projections to the fourth-grade student population in Greece in 2001. Research Design: The research design was secondary analysis. We examined whether class size predicts reading achievement for fourth graders in Greece net of student, teacher/classroom, and school characteristics. We used multilevel models to capture the dependency in the data (i.e., students nested within schools). We also used instrumental variables methods to facilitate causal inferences about class size effects. Conclusions: We investigated the effects of class size on reading achievement for fourth graders in Greece in 2001 using rich data from PIRLS. The results produced from the multilevel and the IV analyses were overall similar. Generally, the results indicated a positive association between class size and achievement. However, the association was typically statistically insignificant, especially when teacher/classroom and school variables were taken (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - We analyze class-size effects on academic achievement in secondary school in Denmark exploiting an institutional setting where pupils cannot predict class size prior to enrollment, and where post-enrollment responses aimed at affecting realized class size are unlikely. We identify class-size effects combining a regression discontinuity design with control for lagged achievement and school fixed effects. Using administrative registry data, we find statistically significant negative effects of class size on academic achievement. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor and Francis Ltd

AB  - This paper analyzes data from Project STAR, an experiment in which 11,600 Tennessee kindergarten students and teachers were randomly assigned to one of three types of classes beginning in the 1985-86 school year: small classes (13-17 students), regular-size classes (22-25 students) teacher's aide. According to the original design, students were to remain in their initial class type through the third grade. In practice, however, students in regular-size classes were randomly re-assigned at the end of kindergarten, and about 10 percent of students moved between class types in second and third grade. Attrition was also common. Several statistical methods are used to investigate the impact of these limitations. The main conclusions are: (1) on average, performance on standardized tests increases by about 4 percentile points the first year students are assigned to a small class, irrespective of the grade in which the student first attends a small class; (2) after initial assignment to a small class, student performance increases by about one percentile point per year relative to those in regular-size classes; (3) teacher aides have little effect on student achievement; (4) class size has a larger effect on test scores for minority students and for those on free lunch; (5) the beneficial effect of smaller classes does not appear to result from Hawthorne effects

AB  - This paper provides a long-term follow-up of students who participated in the Tennessee STAR experiment. The Tennessee STAR experiment randomly assigned 11,600 elementary school students and their teachers to a small class, regular-size class or regular-size class with a teacher-aide. The experiment began with the wave of students who entered kindergarten in 1985, and lasted for four years. After the third grade, all students returned to regular-size classes. We analyze the effect of past attendance in a small class on standardized test scores through the eighth grade, on whether students took the ACT or SAT college entrance exam, and on how they performed on the ACT or SAT exam. The results suggest that attending a small class in the early grades is associated with somewhat higher performance on standardized test, and an increase in the likelihood that students take a college-entrance exam, especially among minority students. Most significantly, being assigned to a small class appears to have narrowed the black-white gap in college-test taking by 54 percent. A calculation is presented suggesting that the internal rate of return from reducing class size from 22 to 15 students is 5.5 percent

AB  - This paper examines evidence on the effect of class size on student achievement. First, it is shown that results of quantitative summaries of the literature, such as Hanushek (1997), depend critically on whether studies are accorded equal weight. When studies are given equal weight, resources are systematically related to student achievement. When weights are in proportion to their number of estimates, resources and achievements are not systematically related. Second, a cost-benefit analysis of class size reduction is performed. Results of the Tennessee STAR class-size experiment suggest that the internal rate of return from reducing class size from 22 to 15 students is around 6%. Copyright Royal Economic Society 2003

AB  - This paper adopts the decomposition technique of DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (DFL, 1996) to decompose provincial differences in the distribution of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test scores and assesses the relative contribution of provincial differences in the distribution of "class size" and time-in-term, other school factors and student background factors. Class size and time-in-term are both important school choice variables and we examine how provincial achievement differences would change if the Alberta distribution of class size and time-in-term prevailed in the other provinces. Results differ by province, and for provinces where mean achievement gaps would be lower, not all students would benefit.

AB  - The renewed focus on the importance of human capital for social development and economic growth, and the recently published evidence on wide international disparities in student achievements, have led to a new interest in the determinants of schooling quality. This paper evaluates the effect on student achievement of an important school input, schooling hours, and compares its effect and cost to that of class size. To overcome the fact that the levels of these inputs are functions of students' ability and past achievement, I use instrumental variables that are derived from two allocation rules that partly determine the level of weekly instruction hours and class size in Israeli primary schools. The instrumental variable results suggest that increasing instruction hours and reducing class size have significant effects on students' achievements. The OLS results, in contrast, show no (or perverse) effects of both inputs on achievement. The cost equivalent tradeoff between instruction hours and class size suggest that it is more cost effective, at the margin, to augment school time than to reduce class size. These results are relevant for assessing recent educational reforms in the U.S. and the U.K. that focus solely on class-size reduction

AB  - This paper considers the analysis of data from randomized trials which offer a sequence of interventions and suffer from a variety of problems in implementation. In experiments that provide treatment in multiple periods (T>1), subjects have up to 2^{T}-1 counterfactual outcomes to be estimated to determine the full sequence of causal effects from the study. Traditional program evaluation and non-experimental estimators are unable to recover parameters of interest to policy makers in this setting, particularly if there is non-ignorable attrition. We examine these issues in the context of Tennessee's highly influential randomized class size study, Project STAR. We demonstrate how a researcher can estimate the full sequence of dynamic treatment effects using a sequential difference in difference strategy that accounts for attrition due to observables using inverse probability weighting M-estimators. These estimates allow us to recover the structural parameters of the small class effects in the underlying education production function and construct dynamic average treatment effects. We present a complete and different picture of the effectiveness of reduced class size and find that accounting for both attrition due to observables and selection due to unobservables is crucial and necessary with data from Project STAR

AB  - The article reports that students who attend small classes throughout early elementary school are significantly more likely to graduate. However, only one or two years of small classes are not enough to make a lasting difference, according to a report from the American Psychological Association. Researchers tracked 4,498 former participants in Tennessee's Project STAR, a 1980s experiment that placed nearly 12,000 students in different class sizes Following nearly 4,500 of those students more than a decade later, researchers found those assigned to the small classes who remained in such settings all four years sustained academic gains. They were also more likely to graduate than those in larger classes

AB  - Using a comprehensive Norwegian administrative database, we exploit independent quasi-experimental methods to estimate the effect of class size on student achievement at the end of lower-secondary school. Identification based on maximum class-size rules and population variation (and variations on these methods) give very similar estimates. We cannot reject that the class-size effect is equal to zero, and can rule out effects as small as 1.5 percent of a standard deviation for a one-student change in class size during three consecutive years

AB  - How does class size in compulsory school affect peoples' long run education and earnings? We use maximum class size rules and Norwegian administrative registries allowing us to observe outcomes up to age 48. We do not find any indication of beneficial effects of class size reduction in compulsory school. For a 1 person reduction in class size we can rule out effects on income as small as 0.087 percent in primary school and 0.12 percent in middle school. Population differences in parental background, school size or competitive pressure do not appear to reconcile our findings with previous studies.

AB  - In this paper the controversial educational topic of class size reduction is addressed. Controlling for a large number of observable characteristics and potential endogeneity in the class size variable, an educational production function is estimated using a quantile regression technique. The "conventional wisdom" that class size reduction is a viable means to increase scholastic achievement is discounted. Rather, the results point towards a far stronger peer effect through which class size reduction may play an important role. Due to heterogeneity in the newly identified peer effect, class size reduction is shown to be a potentially regressive policy measure.

This study examines class size effects on fourth-grade mathematics achievement in 14 European countries using data from TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) 2011. We employ quasi-experimental methodology (i.e., instrumental variables and regression discontinuity) to facilitate causal inferences of class size effects. Although we find some evidence of class size effects in Romania and the Slovak Republic, overall there are no systematic patterns of class size effects across countries. The results indicate that in most European countries class size reduction may not improve mathematics achievement in fourth grade.

AB  - This dissertation is a collection of two essays that address issues of class size effects on student achievement and power analysis methods for model of changes. Class size reduction policies have been widely implemented around the world in the past decades. However, findings about the effects of class size on student achievement have been mixed. In addition, most of the studies about class size effects have focused on the effects on the average achievement for all students. Only a few studies have focused on the differential class size effects across the student achievement distribution, and their findings have been mixed. The first essay (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2) was designed to evaluate class size effects on student achievement. In particular, Chapter 1 employed instrumental variables (IV) methods to examine the causal effects of class size on fourth grade mathematics achievement using data from TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study). While I found some evidence of class size effects in Romania and the Slovak Republic, overall there were no systematic patterns of class size effects. The results indicate that in most European and Asian countries class size reduction may not improve mathematics achievement in fourth grade. The first essay also evaluated the differential class size effects across mathematics achievement distribution. In particular, Chapter 2 employed quantile regression analysis, coupled with instrumental variables methods, to examine the causal effects of class size on fourth grade mathematics achievement. While I found some evidence of quantile-specific class size effects in Romania and the Slovak Republic, overall there were no systematic patterns of class size effects. What is more, there was no evidence to show that high- or low-achievers benefited more from smaller classes. The results indicate that in most European and Asian countries class size reduction may not increase or reduce the achievement gap between low- and high-achieving students in fourth grade. The second essay of this dissertation (Chapter 3) was designed to provide methods for three-level models in studies of polynomial change. Experiments that involve nested structures often assign entire groups to treatment conditions and follow them over time to assess group differences in the average of change, rate of acceleration, or higher degree polynomial effect. Chapter 3 provide methods for power analysis in three-level polynomial change models for cluster randomized designs (i.e., treatment at the third level) and block randomized designs (i.e., treatment at the second level). Both unconditional models and conditional models that include covariates at the second (e.g., student) and the third (e.g., school) levels are discussed. The power computations take into account nesting effects at the second and at the third level, the duration of study, sample size effects (e.g., the numbers of schools and students), and covariates effects. Chapter 3 also provided illustrative examples to show how powers are influenced by the study duration, sample sizes and covariates at the second and the third level.

AB  - Policies about reducing class size have been implemented in the US and Europe in the past decades. Only a few studies have discussed the effects of class size at different levels of student achievement, and their findings have been mixed. We employ quantile regression analysis, coupled with instrumental variables, to examine the causal effects of class size on 4th-grade mathematics achievement at various quantiles. We use data from 14 European countries from the 2011 sample of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Overall, there are no systematic patterns of class-size effects across quantiles. Class-size effects are generally non-significant and uniform at different achievement levels, which suggests that in most European countries class-size reduction does not have an impact on student achievement and does not close the achievement gap. However, combined estimates across countries indicate that high achievers may benefit more from class-size reduction.

AB  - This paper evaluates the long-term effects of class size in primary school. We use rich administrative data from Sweden and exploit variation in class size created by a maximum class size rule. Smaller classes in the last three years of primary school (age 10 to 13) are not only beneficial for cognitive test scores at age 13 but also for non-cognitive scores at that age, for cognitive test scores at ages 16 and 18, and for completed education and wages at age 27 to 42. The estimated effect on wages is much larger than any indirect (imputed) estimate of the wage effect, and is large enough to pass a cost-benefit test.

AB  - Recent analyses challenge common wisdom regarding the superiority of private schools relative to public schools, raising questions about the role of school processes and climate in shaping achievement in different types of schools. While holding demographic factors constant, this multilevel analysis of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics data on over 270,000 fourth and eighth graders in over 10,000 schools examines differences among schools on five critical factors: (1) school size, (2) class size, (3) school climate/parental involvement, (4) teacher certification, and (5) instructional practices. This study provides nationally representative evidence that both teacher certification and some reform-oriented mathematics teaching practices correlate positively with achievement and are more prevalent in public schools than in demographically similar private schools. Additionally, smaller class size, more prevalent in private schools, is significantly correlated with achievement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)

AB  - Two classes of quantile regression estimation methods for the recursive structural equation models of Chesher [2003. Identification in nonseparable models. Econometrica 71, 1405-1441.] are investigated. A class of weighted average derivative estimators based directly on the identification strategy of Chesher is contrasted with a new control variate estimation method. The latter imposes stronger restrictions achieving an asymptotic efficiency bound with respect to the former class. An application of the methods to the study of the effect of class size on the performance of Dutch primary school students shows that (i) reductions in class size are beneficial for good students in language and for weaker students in mathematics, (ii) larger classes appear beneficial for weaker language students, and (iii) the impact of class size on both mean and median performance is negligible

AB  - Education as a road to growth has been on the political agenda in recent years and promoted not least by the institutions of higher education. At the same time the universities have been squeezed for resources for a long period and the average class size has increased as a result. However, the production technology for higher education is not well known and this study highlights the relation between class size and student achievement using a large dataset of 80.000 gradings from the Aarhus School of Business. The estimations show a large negative effect of larger classes on the grade level of students. The type of exam also has a large and significant effect on student achievements and oral exam, take-home exam and group exam reward the student with a significantly higher grade compared with an on-site written exam

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to analyze the initial results of statewide implementation of the PRIME TIME program in Indiana. PRIME TIME is a state-wide program to reduce class size in the primary grades. Mean scores from 65,911 third graders who had completed the Indiana Competency Test in the spring of 1987 after completing 3 years of the program were compared with the scores of 67,987 third graders who had no experience with the program. A difference of only 0.7 points favoring the smaller classes was found on the composite scores of four subtests, suggesting that monetary expenditures for PRIME TIME were not justified by program effects. A test of homogeneity of variance was also performed. Results indicated that the smaller classes caused both high and low scores to regress to the mean. It is concluded that, since smaller classes cost a tremendous amount of money, it is the responsibility of educators to learn when and where reductions of class size are most beneficial to students.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of class size and student achievement in mathematics and reading. The study focused on grades 6 through 8 and used the results of the North Carolina EOG tests in mathematics and reading for the academic year 2006-2007. This study examined the effects of class size and student achievement in selected middle schools in the Sandhills Region of North Carolina. This quantitative study involved an analysis of EOG test scores within the three grade levels to determine if there are significant differences in achievement between small, medium and large size classes. Small classes were defined as having 15 students or less, medium size classes ranged from 16 to 24, and large classes had 25 or more students. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with alpha set at 0.05 significance was used to determine significance differences between the independent variables (class size and gender) and dependent variable (EOG Tests) to evaluate whether there is a significant difference between the average value, or mean, within the three categorical groups. Tukey's HSD was used to determine the nature of the differences between the class sizes. This study indicated that students that were enrolled in the large class size had a significant higher mean score in reading and mathematics than students enrolled in small size classes and a slightly higher mean score than students enrolled in medium size classes. The only exception was in 6th grade reading where there were no significant differences found in reading score means in small, medium or large class sizes. The results also revealed that female students had significantly higher EOG test scores in small classes and only marginal higher scores in medium and large size classes. The only exception was in 8th grade mathematics where male students scored significantly higher in large size classes, but only slightly higher in medium and small size classes.

AB  - In a study of Ontario, Canada's province-wide Primary Class Size Reduction (PCS) Initiative, school districts' ability to direct and support schools was related to their experience with planning and monitoring, interest in innovation, and its human and fiscal resource base. Districts with greater “resource capacity” were able to coordinate local implementation of PCS to ongoing efforts to improve teaching and learning; those with less were unable to manage more than compliance. While class sizes were reduced in every district in Ontario, its impact on teachers and students was not as positive as it might have been.

AB  - This paper assesses the differences in educational attainments between students across classes and schools they are grouped by, in the context of Italian educational system. The purpose is to identify a relationship between pupils' reading test scores and students' characteristics, stratifying for classes, schools and geographical areas. The dataset contains detailed information about more than 500,000 students at the first year of junior secondary school in the year 2012/2013. By means of multilevel linear models, it is possible to estimate statistically significant school and class effects, after adjusting for pupil's characteristics, including prior achievement. The results show that school and class effects are very heterogeneous across macro-areas (Northern, Central and Southern Italy), and that there are substantial discrepancies between and within schools; overall, class effects on achievement tend to be larger than school ones.

AB  - Examined the reading and mathematics achievement test scores of 1,940 2nd graders who had completed 2 yrs of an Indiana program to reduce class sizes (project Prime Time [PT]) in kindergarten and Grades 1–3. PT Ss (average 19.1 Ss/class) were compared with 2,027 students from larger classes (average 26.2 Ss/class). Results of 10 studies of PT and pre-PT classes were combined using Fisher's inverse chi-square procedure, yielding a total of 24 comparisons. PT Ss had higher achievement in basic skills after 2 yrs than did their cohorts in larger classes, indicating that primary school children learn more effectively in smaller classes.

AB  - With few exceptions, empirical research investigating the possibility of heterogeneous benefits of class size reduction lacks a conceptual framework about specific dimensions of potential heterogeneity. In this paper we develop a model of education production that incorporates disruption and student achievement and illustrates how these underlying sources of variation may drive heterogeneity in the benefits of class size reductions. We test for results consistent with this model using the Tennessee STAR data. The estimates show that students in higher poverty schools and with greater learning aptitude realize larger benefits from smaller classes

AB  - Prior research suggests that the benefits from smaller classes may vary along multiple dimensions. In this paper we develop a flexible model of education production that incorporates the classroom-level time lost to disruption and the rate of learning during productive time as a function of teacher quality and individual propensity to acquire knowledge. We then investigate heterogeneity in class size effects by school poverty share, family income, teacher experience, and achievement percentile using data from Project STAR. We find that the benefits of small classes are consistently higher in schools with a larger low-income enrollment share. Conditional on school poverty share, we find little or no evidence that lower-income or lower-achieving students tend to realize larger benefits of smaller classes. Instead, we find that the return to smaller classes tends to increase with achievement regardless of school poverty share. Given the generally higher levels of disruption reported in higher poverty schools, this set of findings is consistent with, though not direct evidence of, the notion that reduced time lost to disruption is a primary mechanism through which smaller classes raise achievement and a compelling explanation for the empirical finding that class-size effects tend to be larger for lower-income children.

AB  - Smaller class sizes in California were viewed as a way to improve K-3 education, especially in the area of literacy. The urgency to act prompted state leaders to adopt class-size reduction (CSR) without knowing for sure that it would work and without establishing a formal procedure for evaluating the program. This report looks at past research on smaller class sizes and the finding that smaller classes do not automatically lead to higher achievement. It details the importance of combining CSR with teacher support and explains that quick-fix training, a shortage of bilingual teachers in California, and the influx of new teachers present their own set of problems. CSR must be part of a comprehensive approach in which schools plan creatively and comprehensively to make CSR part of a larger effort to improve instruction. Promising strategies include the use of ongoing community dialogue, the imaginative use of new and existing resources, and new kinds of collaboration with higher education, the community, and other school districts.

AB  - With class-size reduction (CSR) in California now a reality, some early evaluations of the program are now possible. A contribution to this early assessment is offered here. The paper describes teachers' and parents' renewed confidence in public education despite the challenges presented by the logistics of implementing the program in the nation's largest state. Besides physical space and qualified teachers coming at a premium, questions remain whether the positive results CSR achieved elsewhere will be realized in California. Questions also remain about teacher supply and teaching quality, particularly the disturbing finding that desperation hiring has brought in new teachers who are less experienced, less qualified, and less skilled, on average, than those of previous years. Other effects are evident on teacher preparation and staff development, and an analysis of how teacher supply and facilities will be affected is offered. Some of the responses that teachers and parents have to CSR are given, and numerous equity issues, such as teachers' credentials, are covered. Some of the other factors discussed include sustainability, collective bargaining concerns, and the impact on other programs. Information resources for finding out more about CSR are provided. (RJM)

AB  - Classroom observational measures can provide information about high quality student-teacher interactions, allowing researchers to consider the impacts of these practices on student outcomes. Such measures can take a "process-oriented approach" that considers the nature of interactions between teachers and students, such as the sensitivity of teachers' interactions with students, teachers' effective management of the classroom, and the depth of instruction and quality of feedback given to students--all processes that have been linked to achievement gains (Pianta, Belsky, Houts & Morrison, 2007; Pianta & Hamre, 2009; Ponitz, Rimm-Kaufman, Brock & Nathanson, 2009). Alternatively, observational measures can take a "domain-specific approach" that considers teachers' practices that support information processing in specific subject-areas, such as mathematical problem solving. Seidel and Shavelson conducted a recent meta-analysis that examined the effects of teaching on student learning, considering both domain-specific and process-oriented approaches to teaching in K-12 classrooms. They found that domain-specific processes had larger effects (d = 0.41) on cognitive outcomes in elementary classrooms than all other factors (Seidel & Shavelson, 2007). The present study combines process-oriented and domain specific approaches, using a newly developed measure: the Mathematics Scan (M-Scan) Measure of Mathematics Instructional Quality (Berry, Rimm-Kaufman, Ottmar, Walkowiak & Merritt, 2011). Three primary research questions guided the authors' analyses: (1) What is the contribution of mathematics instructional quality to achievement for low-income students? The authors hypothesized that mathematics instructional quality is a strong predictor of mathematics instructional quality for low-income students, even after controlling for prior achievement, class-size, peer ability level, teachers' experience, and teachers' content knowledge, (2) What is the relative contribution of classroom ability level beyond classroom quality and class size in predicting achievement for low-income third grade students? The authors hypothesized that classroom ability level would contribute to achievement above and beyond mathematical instructional quality and other classroom factors, and (3) Does class size make a difference above and beyond instructional quality and classroom ability level in predicting achievement for low-income third grade students? Their hypothesis was that class size was significantly related to achievement above and beyond mathematics instructional quality and classroom ability level. This research reports the following findings: (1) The authors found that mathematical instructional quality was significantly related to third grade achievement for students from low-income families. For every one point higher a teacher scored on the M-Scan, students scored approximately 12 points higher on a third grade achievement test. Mathematical instructional quality explains 8% of the classroom level variance and 0.4% of the total variance in student achievement after controlling for student prior achievement, teachers' content knowledge, class size, classroom ability level, and teachers' experience level; (2) Results showed the classroom ability level was not a significant predictor of student achievement with all of the other variables in the model. This suggests that when students are offered the same level of instructional quality, teacher content knowledge, teacher experience, and have similar class sizes, the ability level of peers is not significant; and (3) Class size was a significant predictor of achievement for students from low-income families. For every 3 fewer students in a classroom, students scored 11 points higher on the third grade achievement test. Class size explained 28% of the classroom level variance and 3% of the total variance in achievement above and beyond the other variables in the model. Findings suggest the importance of mathematics instructional quality and smaller class size among students from families with low income. Interventions that support teacher improvement in standards-based mathematics may hold promise in efforts to reduce the achievement gap. Appended are: (1) References, and (2) Tables and figures

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between class size and student achievement at the kindergarten level. Different mechanisms through which class size affects achievement are analyzed, in particular the interactive effect of class size and instructional practices. Four questions are posed: Is there a direct effect of class size on student achievement? Is this association mediated by instructional practices? Is there an interaction between class size and instruction? Is the effect of class size different for economically and academically disadvantaged students? The analysis is based on nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). The paper uses both hieararchical linear models of students within classes and teacher fixed effect regressions--to address the issue of unobserved heterogeneity among teachers. Contrary to the Project STAR? results, these findings do not present any evidence of direct effects and only few indirect effects of class size on reading and mathematic student achievement.

AB  - Although experimental results indicate that smaller classes promote higher achievement in early elementary school, the broader literature on class-size effects is inconclusive. This seeming contradiction raises questions about the generalizability of experimental evidence, an issue that this article addresses by examining the effects of class size on achievement in kindergarten with data from a nationwide survey, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99. To distinguish class-level from individual-level effects, this analysis utilizes hierarchical linear models. In response to concerns about selectivity, teacher fixed-effects models are also estimated. In an effort to understand the inconsistent findings of the past, the authors examine classroom conditions that may affect the link between class size and academic achievement, and also consider whether class size has different effects for different groups of students. The authors find no evidence of class-size effects on student achievement in either reading or mathematics, and results indicate that class size is equally insignificant for students from different race/ethnic, economic, and academic backgrounds. Teacher fixed-effects analyses also yield null findings for class size. Instructional activities offer significant boosts to achievement, but the effects of instruction do not differ between small and large classes. The authors discuss why the small class size advantage evidenced by experimental research might not generalize to nonexperimental, naturally occurring settings throughout the nation.

AB  - Reported are the findings of a legislatively mandated study on reducing certain class sizes of grades kindergarten through three to an optimum pupil-teacher ratio for Minnesota's schools. This report, after defining terms, briefly surveys variables affected by class size, such as teaching processes and classroom climate. Research is subsequently placed in its historical context prior to a review of the findings of the two major groups contributing to the literature in the last decade (Glass and Smith, and the Educational Research Services, Inc. surveys) and three selected projects from Indiana, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois, that have statewide implications for Minnesota. Optimum class size in Minnesota is discussed through a review of research, public and professional opinion, and current practices in the 50 States. Discussion next addresses the legislature's request for information on the number of teachers required to reduce the size of reading, writing, and mathematics classes. This topic is discussed within the context of the State Board's new elementary rule, effective 1986-87, requiring that specific proportions of time be given to instruction in certain curriculum areas. The feasibility of reducing class sizes to an optimum pupil-teacher ratio in individual school districts is explored in a trend-revealing 2-year comparison of class sizes. Concluding remarks focus on alternatives to small classes. Related materials are appended: references to research, Minnesota class size data for 1985-86, and projected 1987-88 revenues for Minnesota's school districts. (RH)

AB  - Understanding class size effects on educational achievement remains a preoccupation of many economists. But empirical results are, to this far, still inconclusive. I use the two-stage least squares and the instrumental variable quantile regression methods on Lesothoâ€™s grade 6 students maths and reading test scores to estimate, respectively, the mean and distributional effects of class size. I find strong evidence for putative class size effects on reading achievement, but not on maths achievement. Using the bounds methods of Conley et al (2012), I show that these findings are robust to weak violations of the instrumental variable exclusion restriction requirement. I also find that a small class size generally benefits the low-ability students the most.

AB  - This study evaluated the Class Size Reduction (CSR) program in 34 elementary schools in Kentucky's Jefferson County Public Schools. The CSR program is a federal initiative to help elementary schools improve student learning by hiring additional teachers. Qualitative data were collected using unstructured interviews, site observations, and document analysis. The data examined the impact of CSR on students, teachers, and parental involvement. A management-oriented evaluation model was used to conduct the quantitative or outcome part of the study. The continuous assessment system of Jefferson county and the state of Kentucky provided data collection and instruments. Students were matched by schools with similar socioeconomic characteristics, schools that participated in the assessment at the beginning and end of the school year, and schools having both regular and reduced class size. Results indicated that after the 1-year intervention in third grade, the CSR program did not increase student learning as measured by mathematics and reading standardized tests. Typical implementation strategies used were self-contained classrooms with fewer students and collaborative models with small group activities. The CSR resulted in higher teacher job satisfaction and morale and higher parent participation levels. (Contains 36 references.) (SM)

AB  - A class size reduction (CSR) program was implemented in a large low-performing urban elementary school district. The CSR program helps schools improve student learning by hiring additional teachers so that children in the early elementary grades can attend smaller classes. This study used a participant-oriented evaluation model to examine the impact of the CSR program on participating teachers and principals. Qualitative data were collected via unstructured interviews and triangulated with observations and document analysis. The analysis, based on the grounded theory model, yielded basic themes found in prior research regarding the impact of CSR on teachers' attitudes and beliefs about student learning, teaching, and family context knowledge. Teacher job satisfaction and morale were higher in reduced class size classrooms. The program was very popular among participating teachers and administrators. Small group instruction and diagnostic testing were used more often in smaller classes. Teachers gave students more personal attention in the reduced class size environment. Most teachers felt that the levels of communication and interaction with parents increased notably since the implementation of the CSR program. Some principals experienced problems in relation to number of students enrolled and space limitations. (Contains 39 references.) (SM)

AB  - This research investigates the effect of class size on introductory accounting student performance within the context of an active learning environment. In-class group activities were implemented as an integral part of the learning environment in both small and large sections. Although the class size issue has been investigated before, this paper focuses on whether active learning methods are differentially effective in large and small classes when learning is measured by performance on exams emphasizing analytical problems and essay questions. Because practical and ethical reasons prevented students from being randomly assigned to large and small sections, the research methodology controls for confounding influences. Specifically, we control for the covariates age, attendance, gender, grade point average, and homework completion. Small class students scored significantly higher on the final exam than did students in the large section.

AB  - This was a multi-faceted mixed methods study that investigated several aspects associated to class size and the perceived effects on student achievement in Title I elementary schools. The data collection in this study was conducted through two separate phases. The first qualitative phase was a case study that was comprised of teacher interviews and classroom observations. The case study took place at a Title I school in Central Virginia, chosen for its diverse representativeness of the student population. Classroom interactions were coded during five-minute segments in each full-day classroom observation, as well as field notes made for specific types of instructional methods being used within each Title I classroom: individualized instruction, small group instruction, connecting personally with students, and incorporating technology into daily instruction. While a majority of the interactions within each classroom were positive, patterns emerged within the negative interactions that occurred. Interview responses indicated that the perceived ideal class size for Title I schools is 12-18 students, as well as provided explanations behind the perceived effects of class size on student achievement. Findings from the first phase were used to create a survey that was distributed during the second qualitative phase of this study. This survey was distributed to the larger Title I teacher population within the same school district to generalize the findings from the case study. Finally, systematic student assessment data was collected to compare the perceived effects of class size to the observed effects of class size on student achievement data. Although the findings from the student achievement data were inconclusive, there were several factors associated to class size that are discussed to explain the observed effects on student achievement data in the case study Title I school.

The strategy of free basic education which aims at attaining education for all goals has led to enrolment of more girls in school resulting to overcrowded classrooms, limited resources and decreased quality of education. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of class size on girls' performance in SMT subjects. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and document analysis. Ex-post-facto research design was adopted. Six girls' secondary schools were purposively selected. The study comprised six head teachers, 30 SMT teachers and 416 girls. Data was presented in charts and tables and analysed using mean scores, percentages, correlation and regression coefficients. The study found that students in small class sizes performed better than those in large classes. Interposition strategies were proposed to improve girls' performance in SMT subjects

AB  - The article discusses the results of a study on the benefits of cost-effective policies on improving K-12 education to rural school districts in Minnesota and factors that affect academic achievement. Some of the techniques they used to improve education are dropout prevention, reducing class sizes, public preschool programs and mentoring programs. The benefit-cost ratio of high-quality preschool for high school graduation is 3.33 U.S. dollars. High school completion rate declined by 0.7% for every 10 miles of distance from the nearest high school

AB  - The impact of class size on student achievement remains an open question despite hundreds of empirical studies and the perception among parents, teachers, and policymakers that larger classes are a significant detriment to student development. This study sheds new light on this ambiguity by utilizing nonparametric tests for stochastic dominance to analyze unconditional and conditional test score distributions across students facing different class sizes. Analyzing the conditional distributions of test scores (purged of observables using class-size specific returns), we find that there is little causal effect of marginal reductions in class size on test scores within the range of 20 or more students. However, reductions in class size from above 20 students to below 20 students, as well as marginal reductions in classes with fewer than 20 students, increase test scores for students below the median, but decrease test scores above the median. This nonuniform impact of class size suggests that compensatory school policies, whereby lower-performing students are placed in smaller classes and higher-performing students are placed in larger classes, improves the academic achievement of not just the lower-performing students but also the higher-performing students.

AB  - A primary purpose for reducing the student-teacher ratio in the early grades is to make students more successful in their later years. This document contains two separate, but interrelated reports that examined two aspects of the 1989 Class Size Reduction (CSR) Act in Nevada. The Act called for a reduction in student-teacher ratios for selected kindergarten classes and for grades 1-3. The two studies evaluated the outcomes of CSR in all 17 Nevada school districts. The first study, which examined changes in Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) scores, concluded that the act was successful in reducing the student-teacher ratio within Nevada's second-grade classrooms. Team teaching helped to reduce the ratio for approximately 34 percent of the state's second-grade students. The effect of lower ratios, however, was mixed. Short-term success was reflected in higher reading and mathematics scores. However, special education status, English-Second-Language status, ethnicity, free-lunch eligibility, and class configuration were more important factors than class size in predicting a student's CTBS score. Although a portion of the differences between student scores were explained by class size and student characteristics, approximately 90 percent of the differences were unexplained by the data. Recommendations include: (1) Fully fund the CSR program for the grades it covers; (2) fund programs that target preschools and early intervention programs for special populations; (3) fully fund a comprehensive evaluation of the program; (4) develop a longitudinal evaluation design that relies on existing state-mandated testing; and (5) provide funding to include teacher and staff development. The second study surveyed all Nevada elementary school principals, all first- and second-grade teachers, and parents of students in CSR classrooms. The surveys elicited generally favorable responses toward CSR. (Contains 29 references, 56 tables, and 6 figures.) (LMI)

AB  - The trend towards class size reduction has accelerated over the last decade. However, it is not clear whether small class sizes actually increase the quality of education enough to justify the downsizing cost. This paper intends to capture the effects of class size by using an education production function and by estimating the effects focusing on the following two points. First, we evaluate various aspects of class size effects. This paper uses TIMSS2003 Mathematics and Science data for Japanese public schools’ 8th grade students to estimate the effects of class size on academic achievements and four non-cognitive ability measures (“High motivation”, “Confidence”, “Utility”, “Belong”), which are estimated by using factor analysis to allow quantitative interpretation. Second, we control for endogeneity of class size that results from non-random assignments of students to class. This paper uses the Regression-Discontinuity-Design method which eliminates such biases. We obtained the following two results. First, we did not find a significant relationship between reductions in class size and academic achievements in both subjects. Second, regarding the non-cognitive ability measures, we found that in mathematics “Confidence” increases with class size reduction.

KW  - Tennessee
AB  - Background: Class size reduction (CSR) is an enduring school reform undertaken in an effort to improve academic achievement and has been widely encouraged in the United States. Supporters of CSR often cite the positive contemporaneous and carryover effects of Project STAR. Much has been discussed regarding the robustness of the contemporaneous effects but not regarding that of the carryover effects. Purpose: This article checks the robustness of the carryover effects of STAR's small classes. Setting: STAR was undertaken in 75-79 schools in Tennessee. Participants: Each year in the experimental period, 6,000-7,000 students in grades K-3 participated in the experiment, for a total of 12,000 students during the entire period. Intervention: As students initially entered STAR schools, they were (arguably) randomly assigned to small classes with 13-17 students, regular classes with 22-25 students without teacher aides, and regular classes with 22-25 students with teacher aides. The experiment was performed from 1985 through 1989, but information on STAR students continued to be collected thereafter. Research Design: STAR is a randomized controlled field experiment. Data Analysis: In this article, STAR schools are divided into "effective" schools and "ineffective" schools. Effective schools are defined as schools where the test scores of students in small classes were statistically significantly higher than those of students in regular classes at the 5% level in both math and reading. By contrast, ineffective schools are defined as schools where the test scores of students in small classes were not statistically significantly higher than those of students in regular classes at the 5% level in either math or reading. Separately for effective schools, schools other than effective schools, and ineffective schools, the academic achievement of students is regressed on variables indicating small class assignment, along with student characteristics and school-by-entry wave fixed effects. Findings: The carryover effects of CSR are not robust; they are driven mostly by effective schools, which account for at most a quarter of STAR schools. During this investigation, it is revealed that, in contrast to the protocol of randomization, observable student characteristics in these schools are not randomly distributed between small and regular classes. They are instead distributed in such a way as to increase the academic achievement of students in small classes and decrease that of students in regular classes.

AB  - The current debate about class size is not centered on whether smaller class sizes are desirable. Rather, the debate is whether the costs involved are the best ways to spend taxpayers' monies. This analysis addresses this question for the state of Florida. Using the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test as a measure of educational achievement, a state data set containing information on all elementary schools was used to examine which government-funded inputs were most cost effective. Using a three-step methodology leading to a cost effectiveness analysis, this article finds that reducing class sizes is the most expensive of state inputs that affect achievement scores. Varying the mix of school personnel (administrators, teachers, and teacher aides) and investments in teacher quality (training and experience) are shown to produce the same results (raising test scores) at a lower cost than the reduction of class sizes.

AB  - Between 1985 and 1989, the Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Project studied the effect of class size on student achievement in Tennessee schools. The study examined: (1) small classes of 15 students per teacher; (2) regular classes of 24 students per teacher; and (3) regular classes with a teacher's aide. The sample included students from kindergarten through third grade at inner-city, rural, urban, and suburban schools. Results showed achievement benefits for students from small classes over students from the other classes. A Lasting Benefits Study (LBS) was undertaken to determine whether these gains were maintained at the end of students' participation in regular size fourth-grade classes. This report discusses the LBS findings. A battery of tests was administered to 4,320 fourth-grade students who had been in a Project STAR class during third grade. Achievement in reading, language, math, science, study skills, and social science was assessed. For all achievement measures and all school location types, fourth-grade students who had been in project STAR small classes during third grade showed significant advantages over Project STAR students from the other two class-size conditions. Appendixes include definitions of the school types and tables of test scores. Six references are cited. (BC)

AB  - This paper begins by describing the basic design and scope of Tennessee's Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (Project STAR), which began in 1985. The project was designed to determine the effect of reduced class size on the achievement and development of students in kindergarten through grade three. Findings that demonstrated that students in smaller classes had statistically significant achievement advantages over students in regular classes are discussed. The second part of the paper describes the Lasting Benefits Study (LBS), which addressed the question of what happened when the pupils who benefitted from the smaller class sizes returned in the fourth grade to regular classes. Study findings indicated that positive effects from involvement in a small-size class still remained pervasive two full years after students returned to regular-size classes. The third section of the paper describes Project CHALLENGE, which put into practice the results of Project STAR by reducing the class size in grades K-3 in 17 Tennessee districts to approximately 1:15. Data on students in the project shows that from 1989-90 to 1990-91, they moved up 5.3 ranks in reading and 6.6 ranks in math. Appended are 13 tables of data, a list of data collection instruments used, and a reference list of 32 items. (HOD)

AB  - A 4-year longitudinal study in Tennessee, called the Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Project, examined the effects of class size on student achievement in kindergarten through grade 3. More than 6,000 students from 75 schools in 42 school systems were included in the study. There were three class sizes: small class (13-17 students), regular class (22-26 students), and regular class with a full-time teacher aid. The study found that students in small classes improved more than students in larger classes. Gains children made in kindergarten were maintained through grade 3. Analyses show that class size had an effect in all locations. However, the presence of a teacher aid did not show an effect. The Lasting Benefits Study (LBS) followed STAR students through grade 4 and grade 5 to determine the lasting effects of early small-class involvement. Students who were in STAR small classes in grade 3 were more advanced statistically and educationally and had higher school participation measures than students who were in regular classes. Another study, Project Challenge, provided incentives for class-size reduction in 17 Tennessee counties (1990-1992). Preliminary results show small-class students gained in reading and mathematics levels. Tables and appendices on data-collection methods and results are included. (Contains 32 references.)

AB  - The effects of class size on academic achievement have been studied for decades. Although the results of small scale randomized experiments and large-scale econometric studies point to positive effects of small classes, some scholars have seen the evidence as ambiguous. This paper reports analyses of a 4-year, large-scale randomized experiment on the effects of class size, project STAR in Tennessee. Although implementation was not perfect, these analyses suggest that shortcomings in implementation probably led to underestimates of the effects of class size. The analyses reported here suggest class size effects that are large enough to be important for educational policy and that are quite consistent across schools. Thus, small classes appear to benefit all kinds of students in all kinds of schools

AB  - Examined possible differential effects of small classes on reading and mathematics achievement using data from Project STAR, a 4-yr, large-scale randomized experiment on the effects of class size. The STAR experiment involved 79 elementary schools in 42 school districts. Kindergarten students were randomly assigned to small (13-17 students), larger (22-26 students), or larger classes with a full-time classroom aide. Results show that the small class effects on both reading and mathematics achievement are somewhat larger for minorities and low socioeconomic status (SES) students. However, the differential effects for minority students (interactions) are statistically significant only for reading achievement in one of the models examined, but not others. None of the differential effects of small classes for low SES students are statistically significant. Thus, while there are unambiguous positive effects of small classes on both reading and mathematics achievement, there is no evidence of differential effects for low SES students and only weak evidence of differential effects for minority students in reading achievement.

AB  - Notes that some scholars argue that the effects of small classes in the early grades are not cumulative—that the benefits of small classes accrue in the 1st year of small classes. That argument suggests both policy implications and scientific questions of why additional benefits should not accrue from additional exposure to small classes. In this article, the cumulative effects of small classes on achievement were investigated with data from Project STAR, a 4-year, large-scale randomized experiment on the effects of class size. Controlling for achievement in the previous-year small classes in Grades 1, 2 and 3 yielded additional positive effects on reading and mathematics achievement. Thus, there are additional (cumulative) effects of small classes after the 1st year that may be large enough to be important for education policy.

AB  - During the 1997-98 school year, the Sentry Hill School District made the decision to "redesign" Clayton Elementary School after persistently low student achievement placed the district in the lowest category of the district's accountability system. This case study outlines the changes made at the school. Redesigning the school meant removing all extant staff and hiring an all new staff during the summer of 1999. Most of the decisions about the redesign and how resources would be reallocated to fund it were made by the redesign team. A plan was developed with input from the community that had: (1) a whole-school reform model; (2) an emphasis on literacy; (3) new math and reading curricula; (4) an additional hour of instructional time 4 days a week; (5) reduced class sizes of about 15 students per classroom; (6) inclusion of special-education students in regular classrooms; (7) organizing the school into both vertical and horizontal teams; and (8) providing daily, collaborative planning time for teams of teachers. Many decisions regarding resource reallocation were made by the district. The school has made tremendous strides toward improving literacy among its students, though it is too early to say whether these efforts will result in an increase in student achievement scores.

AB  - This paper proposes empirical likelihood based inference methods for causal effects identified from regression discontinuity designs. We consider both the sharp and fuzzy regression discontinuity designs and treat the regression functions as nonparametric. The proposed inference procedures do not require asymptotic variance estimation and the confidence sets have natural shapes, unlike the conventional Wald-type method. These features are illustrated by simulations and an empirical example which evaluates the effect of class size on pupils' scholastic achievements. Furthermore, for the sharp regression discontinuity design, we show that the empirical likelihood statistic admits a higher-order refinement, so-called the Bartlett correction. Bandwidth selection methods are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of class size on academic achievement have been studied for decades. Although the results of small-scale, randomized experiments and large-scale, econometric studies point to positive effects of small classes, some scholars see the evidence as ambiguous. Recent analyses from a 4-year, large-scale, randomized experiment on the effects of class size (Project STAR in Tennessee) provide evidence that small classes in the early grades lead to increased academic achievement. A major question is whether these benefits of small classes are uniformly distributed across schools and districts. The analyses reported here suggest that class size effects at the 3rd grade vary across districts and that the variation in effects is linked to average teacher salaries in those districts. The question of how to allocate resources to most effectively further the aims of educational systems is one of the enduring questions facing educational researchers and policymakers. Among the most fundamental allocation decisions is the decision of how to assign instructional staff to classes. This includes the decision of how large classes should be and whether ancillary instructional staff, such as classroom aides, should be used. Manipulating class size is a policy option that is gaining increasing attention throughout the nation. In the last two decades many states have adopted policies that reduce class sizes with the goal of improving achievement, and class size reduction often is included in state and local education initiatives. Although decisions about resource allocation (and class size in particular) are made in every educational system, there is serious debate about whether these allocation decisions influence academic achievement and other desired outcomes of education. This research investigates whether assignment to small classes affects academic achievement and, if so, how those effects are distributed across schools with different social compositions and teacher characteristics. The variable of local district teacher salary and its effects is also investigated. (Contains 2 tables and 13 footnotes.)

AB  - The purpose of this research study is to compare student achievement changes between matched QEIA and non-QEIA schools in an effort to infer effects of the most significant feature of QEIA funding, class size reduction. The study addressed the critical question—are there demonstrated, significant differences in student achievement gains between schools with similar demographics? Does participation in a program that reduces class size also make significant differences in achievement gains? Do school districts have data to recommend continuation of this expensive intervention? ANOVA methodology was used to test the research hypothesis. QEIA schools were matched using CDE's Similar School Rank with non-QEIA schools. California API scores prior to starting participation in QEIA (2006) and after participation (2010) were analyzed for percentage of gain and loss over the years of implementation of CSR. The author's assumption is that class size was the QEIA Act's most significant and uniform factor and that differences between the groups can be, at least, partially, if not primarily, due to CSR. Fifteen t-tests at three grade levels (elementary, middle, and high school) and two subgroups for Hispanic and ELL students were conducted. Because data for the African-American (Black) and White subgroups was limited, analysis on these two subgroups was not conducted. Findings suggest the following: QEIA schools started with a lower average and range of API scores than their non-QEIA matches. Four years later, QEIA elementary schools with reduced class size gained an average of 13.75 additional school-wide API points over their non-QEIA school matches. Hispanic students in QEIA schools improved an average of 13 additional points, while the ELL subgroup showed 20 additional points gained over their non-QEIA school matches. QEIA middle schools averaged 8 additional API points gained over the four years. At the high school level, non-QEIA schools outperformed matched QEIA schools by an 8.65 point gain. In conclusion, while QEIA schools, except for those at the high school level, did show greater increases in API scores, there is not a significant positive increase and substantial improvement over their non-QEIA school matches.

AB  - The exceptionally large 'Tennessee experiment'-involving 7000 pupils-to elucidate the effects of class-size on primary school pupils' rate of learning has been widely interpreted as showing convincingly that classes of 15 pupils learn more rapidly, in an important sense, than classes of 24 pupils. The present re-analysis in terms of value-added in learning-the annual increase in SAT scores (rather than the absolute levels of those scares)-indicates that the benefits to average children resulting simply from a lowering of class-size, while positive, are negligible in magnitude and not justifiable in relation to the additional economic resources required. The paper suggests that benefits are more likely to result from targeting additional resources to improved teaching styles, improved teaching materials and providing small classes for pupils with recognised learning difficulties; further research on class-size needs to concentrate on the correct proportion of low-attaining pupils that would benefit from attending small classes, the optimal size of such classes, and the fractions of the day which pupils with varying difficulties should attend small and normal-sized classes

AB  - Young children's learning--and how their learning is distributed by social background--may be influenced by the structural and organizational properties of their school. This study focuses on one important structural dimension of these educational contexts: "size." This study differs from extant studies linking size to student outcomes in four important respects. First, the authors focus on elementary school size. Second, they conceptualize the size of educational contexts quite broadly, focusing on the relative impacts of class size and school size, while simultaneously accounting for grade span. Third, they explore the effects of these structural characteristics of elementary schools on both learning and the equitable distribution of that learning by children's social background, particularly race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Fourth, their research design provides considerable methodological leverage with which to disentangle the confounding effects on student learning of student background and the size of elementary school contexts. In this study, the authors employ data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). They also employ hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) within a three-level growth-curve framework. They present both descriptive and multivariate results. Their descriptive results provide information about both children and schools, organized by the size of their classes and schools. They also present their within-school and between-school multivariate and multilevel HLM results separately. Their within-school results describe the relationships between child-level characteristics and student learning. Their between-school models explore the effects of elementary school organizational size on student learning. The results suggest robust class-size effects, net of school size, the types of students enrolled, and other school-level characteristics; the effects of both class size and school size are estimated in the same models. That is, the class-size effects the authors report here are independent of school size, and vice versa. In this study, the authors find that organizational size--of both classes and schools--influences children's learning in literacy and mathematics in both kindergarten and first grade.

AB  - Using data from the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment and subsequent follow-up surveys, we estimate unconditional quantile treatment e ects of being assigned to a small-size class and a regular-size class with an aide, compared to regular-size one. Results show that mid-achievers pro t the most from being assigned to a small class. Students at the bottom or top of the achievement distribution experience almost no gain. The analysis also reveals a positive and signi cant e ect of a regular class with teacher's aide for students at the bottom of the achievement distribution, an effect stronger for boys and disadvantaged pupils. In line with previous research, we show that being assigned to a small class during K-3 grades has a positive e ect test scores in later grades, on the likelihood of on-time high school graduation, and on taking the ACT/SAT exam. However, these positive e ects are driven mostly by students who were high achievers during Project STAR, suggesting that the long-term bene ts of being in a small class shrink very quickly for low- and mid-achieving students.

AB  - The London studies of school effectiveness in the 1970s provided evidence that the qualities of schools made a significant difference to pupil progress, after taking account of the characteristics and backgrounds of the pupils at the time of school entry. The purpose of this article is to review the further evidence that has accumulated since then in order to assess how far the findings have been confirmed or refuted, what new questions have arisen and what key challenges remain. The continuing areas of research and debate include school effects on behavioral outcomes, the effects of class size, the importance of parental involvement, the impact of intake mix, peer influences, and level of resources. There has been greater agreement on the many features fostering school effectiveness. However, questions remain on how to bring about desired changes. The paper concludes by drawing attention to 10 largely unanswered questions that matter for policy and practice.

AB  - Using a comprehensive administrative database we exploit independent quasiexperimental methods to estimate the effect of class size on student achievement in Norway. The first method is based on a maximum class size rule in the spirit Angrist and Lavy (1999). The second method exploits population variation as first proposed by Hoxby (2000). The results of both methods (and of variations on these methods) are very similar and cannot reject that the class size effect is equal to zero. The estimates are very precise; we can rule out effects as small as 1.5 percent of a standard deviation for a one student change in class size during three years in a row.

AB  - Problem Statement: The physical environment of the classroom has an impact on various components of the teaching and learning processes. Recently, there has been research into the relationship between classroom management and the physical environment in elementary schools. However, the focus of these studies was only on one dimension of the physical environment of the classroom such as the relationship between class size or the physical environment and academic achievement. Therefore, there is a need for research into how early childhood teachers perceive the impact of the physical environment on classroom management. Purpose of Study: This study aimed to examine the perceptions of a group of early childhood teachers in Ankara, Turkey, in relation to the influence of the physical environment of the classroom on classroom management. More specifically, the present study examined teachers' perceptions about the factors that influence their classroom management practices, how the physical environment of the classroom influences their instructional processes and teacher-student interactions, and elicited suggestions from teachers about improving the physical environment. Method: This study is a qualitative study where the data was obtained from a semi-structured interview schedule containing 16 questions; six pertained to demographic items while the remaining 10 open-ended questions aimed to investigate the teacher's perceptions. The participants were 36 female early childhood education teachers. Findings: Content analysis was performed at the end of the study. The themes that emerged from the findings were categorized as follows: (1) factors influencing classroom management, (2) Physical characteristics of classrooms, (3) strengths and weaknesses of the physical environment, (4) remedies for the weaknesses of the environment, and (5) suggestions for improving the physical environment. Conclusions and Recommendations: A combination of semi-structured interviews and observations of classroom practice can create a wider picture of the teachers' perceptions. In addition, since the physical environment is important in both primary and secondary education, the same study could be applied to teachers working at other grade levels to examine their beliefs concerning the relationship between the physical environment and classroom management

AB  - This study investigated the possible causes of the contradiction between the results of two projects. Indiana's Prime Time project compared the achievement of students in large (averaging 26 students) and small (averaging 19 students) classrooms in grades 1 through 3. Results indicated that 3 years in smaller classes had little effect on student achievement. Tennessee's Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project was a longitudinal study of class-size effects on student achievement in kindergarten through grade 3. The study concluded that small classes (13-17 students) had an advantage over large classes (22-26 students) in reading and mathematics. The present study examined whether students in the small classes in the STAR program really learned more than students in the large classes, and offered four hypotheses: (1) there was a relationship between the methodologies of the two projects and the contradictions in their results; (2) a Hawthorne effect occurred in the STAR program, according to which students in experimental groups tried harder than students in control groups; (3) a John Henry effect occurred in the STAR program, according to which students in control groups did not try harder than students in experimental groups; and (4) the research methodology of the STAR project was no better than that of the Prime Time project. The present study collected information about both projects' methodologies, designs, and circumstances. The study concluded that evidence did not definitively confirm a Hawthorne or John Henry effect, and that the STAR methodology was not better than the Prime Time methodology. (TM)

AB  - What is the impact of good-quality early education on someone's life? The traditional answer was that children who attended smaller classrooms and had more experienced teachers early in life would have better test scores during elementary school, but that this effect would slowly fade: By high school, no impact was detected on their IQ or test scores when compared with children with "average" early education. However, some new research is challenging this view, pointing toward a more dramatic impact of early education on adult outcomes. From 1985 to 1989 more than 10,000 Tennessee primary school children were randomly assigned to small, regular size, or regular-size classes with a teacher's aide as part of the Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Project. Skills such as self-control, perseverance, and dependability, which are not measured on test scores, can indeed be learned in preschool and may have a major impact on adult outcomes. Investing in early childhood education seems to be a particularly cost-effective way to spend public money, for the benefit of individuals and society as a whole.

AB  - Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio) was a large-scale randomized trial of reduced class sizes in kindergarten through the third grade. Because of the scope of the experiment, it has been used in many policy discussions. For example, the California statewide class-size-reduction policy was justified, in part, by the successes of Project STAR. Recent (failed) proposals in the Senate that sought federal assistance for class-size reductions were motivated by Project STAR research. Even the recent discussion of small schools often conflates the notion of small schools and smaller classrooms. Because of the importance of Project STAR, it has been studied by many scholars looking at a wide variety of outcomes and even exploiting the randomization to understand variations in inputs and other aspects of the education production function that do not directly relate to class size. This paper provides an overview of the academic literature using the Project STAR experiment. Given the scarcity of large-scale educational experiments like Project STAR, it is important to learn as much as possible from the experiment. Researchers have combed through the experiment to learn not only about the effects of reduced class size on test scores but also to gain insight into classroom dynamics. Overall, Project STAR indicates that reducing class size is a reasonable economic investment: the benefits are sizable and long lasting, especially for black students, and the overall benefits outweigh the costs.

AB  - New York City's Early Grade Improvement Program (EGIP) was initiated in the 1985-86 school year as an effort to improve pupil achievement in the primary grades through a reduction of class size. Schools without sufficient space to reduce class size through creation of new classes were given EGIP funds to provide paraprofessional assistance to classroom teachers or to provide two teachers per class. This evaluation of EGIP for 1986-87 focuses on second grade students and consists of three parts. The first is a summary of district self-assessments of EGIP implementation. The second is a presentation of demographic profiles of the city-wide second-grade populations for 1985-86 and 1986-87. The third is a comparison of outcome data for the two academic years. Outcome data are of two kinds: descriptive data about second-grade classroom configurations and pupil achievement data. Achievement and class size data for each community school district are presented in appendices. (RH)

AB  - The study investigated the effects of four class sizes (16, 23, 30, and 37) on teachers' expectations; the attitudes and opinions of participants (students and teachers); student achievement in reading, mathematics, composition, and art; student self-concept; and a variety of classroom process variables (e. g., teacher-pupil interaction, pupil participation, method of instruction). Teachers and students were randomly assigned to a class size in Grades 4 and 5. A total of 62 classes in three school districts in Metropolitan Toronto participated in the two-year study. Findings indicated that teachers had definite expectations of class size effects that subsequently were reported to be confirmed by their experience in the study. However, most other results failed to support teachers' opinions. Few of the observed classroom process variables were affected by class size. Although students' mathematics-concept scores were higher in size 16 than 30 or 37, there were no class size effects for the other achievement measures (reading, vocabulary, mathematics-problem solving, art, and composition) or for students' attitudes and self-concepts

AB  - This article addresses three questions: Does reduced class size cause higher academic achievement in reading, mathematics, listening, and word recognition skills? If it does, how large are these effects? Does the magnitude of such effects vary significantly across schools? The authors analyze data from Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio study (STAR) of 1985, where students and teachers are randomly assigned to a small or regular class. The authors propose a three-level multivariate simultaneous equation model with an instrumental variable (IV) and estimation via maximum likelihood (ML) to analyze the data under an assumption of data missing at random (MAR). The IV, random assignment of students to a small or regular class, reduces class size which, by hypothesis, improves academic achievement in these domains. The authors extend Rubin's Causal Model (RCM) by involving a modified Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), requiring no interference between classrooms and intact schools. The method accommodates data with a general missing pattern and extracts full information for analysis from the STAR data. The authors investigate both homogenous and heterogenous causal effects of class size on academic achievement scores across schools. The results show that reducing class size improves reading, mathematics, listening, and word recognition test scores from kindergarten to third grade, although the effects appear relatively small in second grade. The authors find no evidence that the causal effects vary across schools. (Contains 2 figures and 6 tables.)

Do Black students benefit more than other students from reduced class size? Does the magnitude of the minority advantages vary significantly across schools? This article addresses the causal questions via analysis of experimental data from Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio study where students and teachers are randomly assigned to small or regular class type. Causal inference is based on a three-level multivariate simultaneous equation model (SM) where the class type as an instrumental variable (IV) and class size as an endogenous regressor interact with a Black student indicator. The randomized IV causes class size to vary which, by hypothesis, influences academic achievement overall and moderates a disparity in academic achievement between Black and other students. Within each subpopulation characterized by the ethnicity, the effect of reduced class size on academic achievement is the average causal effect. The difference in the average causal effects between the race ethnic groups yields the causal disparity in academic achievement. The SM efficiently handles ignorable missing data with a general missing pattern and is estimated by maximum likelihood. This approach extends Rubin's causal model to a three-level SM with cross-level causal interaction effects, requiring intact schools and no interference between classrooms as a modified Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption. The results show that, for Black students, reduced class size causes higher academic achievement in the four domains each year from kindergarten to third grade, while for other students, it improves the four outcomes except for first-grade listening in kindergarten and first grade only. Evidence shows that Black students benefit more than others from reduced class size in first-, second-, and third-grade academic achievement. This article does not find evidence that the causal minority disparities are heterogeneous across schools in any given year. (Contains 3 figures, 4 tables, and 1 note.)

According to a national survey by the Australian Education Union, primary schools in New South Wales have the largest proportion of classes with more than 30 students. The Federation exerted effort to campaign prior to the 2003 State Election to achieve class size reductions in K-2. Teachers agree with the need for further class-size reductions in order to enhance student understanding and welfare

AB  - The California class size reduction program provided schools with cash rewards for K-3 classes of 20 or fewer students. I show how program rules made it possible for schools to save money by using mixed-grade classes to meet class size reduction obligations while maintaining larger average class sizes. I also show that this smoothing of students across grades is associated with a significant test score gap for certain second and third grade students. My estimates suggest that class size reduction may lead to lower test scores for students placed in combination classes. Alternative explanations of teacher experience and credentialing changes cannot explain the test score pattern. This result spotlights both the underappreciated role of age heterogeneity in classroom learning and the difficulty of replicating the success of policy experiments in statewide reform.

Cooper (see record [rid]1989-31150-001[/rid]), and summarizes the findings of experimental studies that compared the achievement levels of elementary school students in larger classes to those in classes with no more than 20 students. Even in studies that made such substantial reductions, achievement differences were slight, averaging only 13% of a standard deviation. Not until class size approached one pupil per teacher was there evidence of meaningful effects. Chapter 1 programs may provide one-to-one tutoring in reading rather than providing small-group pullouts or reducing overall class size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Understanding the effects of class size reduction (CSR) has been an enduring issue in education. For the past 3 decades, Project STAR has stimulated research and policy discussions regarding the effects of CSR on a variety of outcomes. Schanzenbach (2007) reviewed STAR studies and concluded that small classes improved student academic outcomes. Since her review, however, some research has challenged this conclusion. This paper reviews these recent challenges, comparing past and recent studies. This review is considered together with studies on large-scale CSR policies in the US and CSR studies outside the US. We conclude by suggesting a direction for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examined the impact of the second year of the federal class-size reduction (CSR) program in the Wake County Public School System (WCPSS), North Carolina. The 23 participating schools in the WCPSS had from 22% to 51% of their students receiving free or reduced-price lunches. In the second year, the CSR program was expanded from grades 1 and 2 to include grade 3. The achievement of students in schools where CSR was implemented at one grade level was compared with the achievement of students in participating schools where CSR was implemented at another level. Outcome measures were grade level standards of the countys literacy and mathematics assessments for grades 1 and 2 and the states end-of-grade tests at grade 3. The average reduction accomplished through the CSR was only 3.9 students per class, and classes of 18 students or fewer were only possible in 5 of the 23 project schools. At grades 1 and 2 data did indicate that the increase in the percentage of students meeting the grade-level standards was greater for students in the reduced-size classes than in regular-size classes. This was true for reading and mathematics. At grade 3, there were no significant differences in reading and mathematics achievement between students in reduced-size classes and those in regular-size classes after controlling for free or reduced-price lunch status and differences in pretest scores. Recommendations are made for improving the CSR program using the model in which an additional teacher is used to make up a new class, reducing the size of all classes about equally. One attachment shows the class size reduction achieved at each school, and the other contains the teachers survey about CSR. (SLD)

AB  - In 2001-2002, 23 schools in the Wake County Public School System (WCPSS), North Carolina, were provided with 40 teacher positions through the Class Size Reduction Program (CSR). Achievement results for students in reduced class sizes were compared with those of similar students in other CSR schools who did not choose the same grade for the project (keeping school and student demographics similar). At grades 1 and 2, WCPSS K-2 Literacy and Mathematics Assessments were compared pre (spring 2001) and post (spring 2002). These analyses yielded mixed results: (1) an increase in the percentage of students meeting the reading-book-level standards was greater for student in the reduced-size classes at grade 2 but not at grade 1; and (2) an increase in the percentage of students meeting the mathematics standards was greater for students in the reduced-size classes at grade 1 but not at grade 2. As in the previous year at grade 3, the North Carolina End-of-Grade fall pretest and spring posttest data indicate that, controlling for differences in pretest scores and free and reduced price lunch status of students, there were no significant differences in reading and mathematics achievement between students in reduced-size classes and those in regular-sized classes. AS in previous years, WCPSS generally did not reach a class size of 18, the goal of the enabling legislation, and it was again recommended that schools receiving 2 CSR teacher positions should place 2 teachers at the same grade level to reduce class sizes at a single grade. Three attachments contain tables of class achievement data. (Contains 15 tables.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - This report discusses the results of the third year--1998-99--of California's Class Size Reduction (CSR) program. Assessments of the program show that CSR was almost fully implemented by 1998-99, with over 92 percent of students in K-3 in classes of 20 or fewer students. Those K-3 classes that had not been reduced in size were concentrated in districts serving high percentages of minority, low-income, or English-learner (EL) students. The average qualifications of California teachers declined for all grade levels, but the declines were worse in elementary schools. Although the qualifications of K-3 teachers continued to decline, it was at a slower rate than in the past. Declines in teacher qualifications were mirrored in grades 4 and 5. Curriculum and instruction were mostly similar regardless of class size, though teachers in reduced-size classes spent more time working individually with students during mathematics and language arts lessons than did their counterparts in nonreduced-size classes. Student achievement did improve in the reduced-size classes, and these positive gains were evident with all students, regardless of their backgrounds. These positive effects continued in grade 4 and regular-size classes. Finally, programs serving EL students and special-education students were affected by the transfer of teachers from these areas into regular classes. (RJM)

AB  - Research studies on class size date back to 1900. Common sense has suggested that small classes lead to greater academic achievement, but most research on the effects of class size on achievement have been inconclusive. Furthermore, the financial costs and political consequences of reducing class size have generally prohibited the adoption of class size reduction alternatives. The Department of Education in the State of Indiana, however, has adopted Project PRIMETIME, which has attempted to reduce the class size in primary grades throughout the state. This document reports on the effect on student learning of reducing first grade class size to 18 students or fewer. Subjects for the studies were first-grade students in three elementary schools in Princeton, Indiana. Results of 13 studies, focusing mainly on basic reading and mathematics skills, provide overwhelming evidence of the gains in scores for students in the small-size classes of the 1984-85 school year as compared to the larger classes of the previous year. Four tables, one page of references, copies of the reading and mathematics evaluation systems, and a letter from the governor are appended. (IW)

AB  - This paper provides a long-term follow-up analysis of students who participated in the Tennessee STAR experiment. In this experiment, students and their teachers were randomly assigned to small, regular-size, or regular-size classes with a teacher aide in the first four years of school. We analyse the effect of past attendance in small classes on student test scores and whether they took the ACT or SAT college entrance exam. Attending a small class in the early grades is associated with an increased likelihood of taking a college-entrance exam, especially among minority students, and somewhat higher test scores.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to investigate the influences of calendar year, year level, gender and language background other than English (LBOTE) on student achievement in literacy and numeracy relative to class size. Design/methodology/approach: Data for this study were collected over five years (2008-2012) as test results from the Australian National Assessment Plan in Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) in Years 3 and 5 from over 100 Sydney primary schools. Findings: It was found that the most important factors influencing academic performance in literacy and numeracy were, in descending order: gender, LBOTE, the calendar year in which the test was conducted, followed by class size. All variables were significantly associated with NAPLAN performance, but effect size estimates for class size were close to zero. Originality/value: The results of this study support other studies suggesting that factors other than class size are more important in influencing academic performance.

AB  - Although recent evidence suggests that non-cognitive skills such as engagement matter for academic and economic success, there is little evidence on how key educational inputs affect the development of these skills. We present a re-analysis of follow-up data from the Project STAR class-size experiment and find evidence that early-grade class-size reductions did improve subsequent student initiative. However, these effects did not persist into the 8th grade. Furthermore, the external and, possibly, the internal validity of these inferences is compromised by non-random attrition. We also present a complementary analysis based on nationally representative survey data and a research design that relies on contemporaneous within-student and within-teacher comparisons across two academic subjects. Our results indicate that smaller classes in 8th grade lead to improvements in measures of student engagement with effect sizes ranging from 0.05 to 0.09 and smaller effects persisting two years later. Using the estimated earnings impact of these non-cognitive skills and the direct cost of a class-size reduction, the implied internal rate of return from an 8th-grade class-size reduction is 4.6 percent overall, but 7.9 percent in urban schools.

AB  - Most research on the positive effects of class-size reduction (CSR) has occurred in the elementary level (Word, Johnston, Bain, Fulton, Zaharias, Lintz, Achilles, Folger, & Breda, 1990; Molnar, Smith, Zahorik, Palmer, Halbach, & Ehrle, 1999). Is CSR an important variable in improving education in the middle grades? Can small classes be achieved in the middle grades at reasonable costs? This article provides an overview of a three-year initiative (2001-2004) to lower class sizes in a middle school through structural changes. Based on initial pre- and post-test data, the process and student outcomes have been positive. All improvements occurred at no added cost. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Class-size reduction (CSR) initiatives have demonstrated positive short- and long-term effects in elementary grades. Less is known about CSR influence on achievement in middle grades. Thus, we conducted a non-experimental, longitudinal, explanatory study of CSR influence on writing achievement of 3 independent cohorts of students (n = 123) in Grades 6 through 8. Analysis of variance was used to analyze results from the narrative writing section of the New Jersey Grade Eight Proficiency Assessment. The CSR had a statistically significant influence on the achievement of students who received CSR for 3 consecutive years (n = 38) and was practically significant (d = 0.61 and 0.79) compared to students who received CSR for one year (n = 42), and students who did not receive the treatment (n = 43), respectively.

AB  - The school board of a school district in South Carolina has proposed to increase class size in all schools due to mandatory budgetary reductions. However, at the secondary school level, the literature on the effect of larger class size on student achievement is conflicting. The theoretical framework by Lazear suggested that the minimization of negative externalities (i.e., problematic behavioral and academic characteristics of students) achieved through the mechanism of smaller class size impacts student learning. Reducing the number of students in a classroom alters the entire classroom environment, creating a more positive learning environment in which students are able to forge better relationships with classmates and teachers. The research question for this study examined whether class size in secondary school predicted student achievement as measured by teacher-issued end-of-course numerical student grades (TIECNSG). The study used a correlational design with a sample of 17,582 TIECNSG from 5 secondary schools in the district. The effect of smaller class sizes on TIECNSG was determined through the use of a linear regression model. For 9 course offerings, an increase in class size resulted in a decrease in TIECNSG, whereas for 8 course offerings, an increase in class size resulted in an increase in TIECNSG. The results of this study, therefore, were inconclusive, suggesting that other unaccounted confounding variables may have affected student achievement. This study can be used to promote positive social change by creating a dialogue between parents and school administrators who often have opposing points of view in terms of the effects of class size. In addition, it is recommended that a district’s school board should authorize additional studies prior to taking any course of action that would affect class size at the secondary school level.

AB  - Although great interest surrounds class size as a policy instrument, inferences on its effects are controversial. Recent work highlights a particular way to consider the endogeneity issues that affect this variable: class size is often correlated with enrollment, which in turn may be related to socioeconomic status (SES). This paper shows why such correlations may be prevalent in developing countries and that they are indeed a relevant feature in Bolivia. These correlations may partially account for why conventional cross-sectional analyses suggest that larger classes have no effect on or even may raise test scores. The endogeneity issues were addressed through two empirical strategies emerging from institutional arrangements that determine pupil/teacher ratios in rural Bolivia. The first approach exploits a teacher allocation practice that allows schools having classes with more than 30 students to apply for an additional teacher. In these circumstances, enrollment and class size are not "smoothly" related, and their effects may be disentangled. The second strategy considers only remote rural schools with less than 30 students and a single class per grade. In such cases, the enrollment/SES correlations that cause bias are less significant. Analyses focused on grade 3 data. Results of all variations of the research strategies suggest that class size has a negative, significant impact on standardized test scores.

Recent work highlights a particular way to consider the endogeneity issues that affect this variable: class size is often correlated with enrollment, which may in turn be related to socioeconomic status. In Bolivia, the author shows, these correlations are significant. Building from institutional arrangements that determine pupil-teacher ratios in rural areas, the author implements two research designs to deal with this issue. The first uses a teacher allocation pattern as an instrumental variable; the second relies on variation from remote schools with a single class per grade. Both suggest that class size has a negative effect on test scores.

AB  - This note implements two research designs that attempt to isolate the effect of class size on achievement. A first strategy focuses on variation in class size in rural schools with fewer than 30 students, and hence only one classroom, per grade. Second, an approach similar to Angrist and Lavy's exploits regulations that allow schools with more than 30 students in a given grade to obtain an additional teacher. Both designs suggest class size negatively affects test scores. © 2006 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - This article investigates the effect of change in average age, socio‐economic status (SES) and class size upon the change in average reading achievement between the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2001 and PIRLS 2006 at the country level. First, we consider the effect of age upon reading achievement. We use regression–discontinuity to analyze the effects of age and schooling upon reading achievement. A tentative correction for age differences yields a new ranking of countries with regard to their corrected average achievement in PIRLS 2006. Second, in order to facilitate cross‐country comparisons in respect of educational equity, we construct internationally acceptable SES indices for PIRLS 2001 and PIRLS 2006. Third, we investigate the effects of change in class size, age and SES upon the change in reading achievement through regressions. We find that the change in reading achievement at the country level can be partially explained by the change in age but not by the change in SE..

AB  - This article focuses on a British study which suggests that students at the upper elementary school level don't learn more in small classes than they do in large ones. The study, published last month by researchers from the University of London's Institute of Education, tracked the academic progress of 21,000 British children over three years of schooling. Looking at students' annual scores on tests of mathematics, English, and science, the researchers conclude, for the most part, that class size seemed to matter little to the students' academic progress

AB  - In this article Anna Vignoles reports the results of a recent research project which evaluated the effects of class size and expenditure per pupil in secondary schools on students' academic performance and their subsequent earnings. Controversially she concludes that simply providing secondary schools with more resources is not likely to improve student outcomes, although increasing class sizes dramatically would almost certainly have a negative impact. The implication of this research is that attention should be focused on identifying the characteristics and management strategies of successful secondary schools.

AB  - This paper uses data from the Norwegian elementary school to test whether students from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit from smaller classes. The data cover one cohort of fourth graders who have been treated in small versus large classes for a period of three years. The Norwegian class size rule of maximum 28 students is used to generate credible exogenous class size variation. We find significant class size effects for the subgroup of students with parents who are educated at or below the upper secondary school level, and for the subgroup of students from dissolved families. The estimated effects for the former subgroup are smaller than those reported from STAR, while the effects for the latter subgroup are within the range reported from the STAR-studies.

AB  - The study explored the effects of two kindergarten program organization factors--length of school day and class size--on kindergartners' reading, math and general knowledge achievement at the end of the kindergarten year. Two waves of data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) with an analytic sample of 15,575 children. A slight positive relationship was found between small class size and children's achievement in reading and math, particularly for children from minority and lower SES backgrounds. No relationship was linked with class size and general knowledge achievement. The relationship between full-day program and the three early academic skills was positive and statistically significant: almost all children made slightly higher gains in full-day programs compared with their counterparts in part-day programs. The findings suggest that policy makers may consider reducing very large class size and making full-day programs available to young children, particularly to poor minority children, at the same time aligning class size and length of kindergarten day with a child's characteristics and school curriculum.

Sorting effects are identified by subtracting the causal effect of class size on performance from their total correlation. Our empirical results indicate substantial compensatory sorting within and especially between schools in many countries. Only the United States, a country with decentralized education finance and considerable residential mobility, exhibits regressive between-school sorting. Between-school sorting is more compensatory in systems with ability tracking. Within-school sorting is more compensatory when administrators rather than teachers assign students to classrooms

AB  - When California implemented its class-size reduction (CSR) program in 1996, a number of questions regarding financial burdens, teacher shortages, scarcity of facilities, and collective bargaining were raised. This first-year implementation study aims to provide some contextual information as background for answering questions, to clarify these issues and to provide a more comprehensive, long-term evaluation of CSR, contextual information. In section 1, the introduction examines the status of the class-size reduction initiative and discusses what the research says. Section 2 provides the study design and then describes the major findings, focusing on the effects on special populations, on staff development, on classroom practices, on parent involvement, and on implementation challenges. Section 3 contains detailed coverage of findings in these same areas of focus. Section 4 provides an overview of policy and research implications of CSR. The emphasis throughout the report is on the perceptions of school-level educators, so as to provide evidence of how CSR unfolded in particular schools across California in its first year of implementation. Findings show that district officials, teachers, principals, and coordinators generally believe that CSR will lead to high student achievement. Some specific areas of CSR that warrant more careful evaluation are provided. (Contains 36 endnotes and 51 references.) (RJM)

AB  - We analyze the effects of instruction time and class size on student achievement in Germany. Using econometric evaluation techniques we are able to deal with unobserved heterogeneity in the student body. Specifically we apply first-difference methods and matching across subjects to control for overall student ability and specific skills. We find that an increase in class size reduces the performance of the students, while additional lessons improve the test score achievement. Both effects differ across federal states and individuals: Additional instruction time in states with central exit examinations enhances performance, while there is no effect in states without central exit examinations and more able students profit more from additional lessons as compared to their less able fellow students. We furthermore show that that reductions in class size accompanied by a decrease in instruction time can be a cost neutral instrument to raise student performance in states with central exit examinations.

AB  - We employ a combination of school fixed effects and IV estimation to estimate the effect of class size on student performance in 18 countries. Using the random part of the class-size variation between two adjacent grades within individual schools allows us to identify causal class-size effects. Conventional estimates of class-size effects are shown to be severely biased in most school systems by within- and between-school sorting of students. Differences in our estimates across countries suggest that it is misleading to generalize results from one school system to others. While we find sizable beneficial effects of smaller classes in Greece and Iceland, the possibility of even small effects is rejected in Japan and Singapore. In 11 countries, we rule out large class-size effects. The existence of class-size effects, and the lack thereof, in different school systems appears to be related to the relative quality of the teaching force.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

AB  - Discusses class size in public education, particularly in the early elementary grades, as a subject of great public discourse and debate, and notes that research on class size faces significant challenges in defining relevant variables, particularly "small class," "large class," and "reduction." In addition, class size may have differential effects for some types and ages of students. Findings indicate that at the extremes, the size of the class will have discernible and meaningful effects on students' learning. With the more usual class sizes, however, the findings are less consistent but seem to slightly favor smaller classes. Nonetheless, many variables other than class size influence students' learning and behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This document provides the final summary report of Tennessee's primary school class size study, called Project STAR. Sections of the report concern: (1) background; (2) organization to conduct the study; (3) sample selection; (4) data collection plan and data base; (5) general operating guidelines; (6) teacher orientation; (7) study design; (8) choice of within-school design; (9) selection into the three conditions; (10) modifications in study design; (11) primary analysis methodology; (12) achievement results; (13) noncognitive results; (14) acheivement results based on effect size; (15) the effect of small classes on grade retention; (16) the effect of inservice teacher training on student achievement; (17) teacher grouping practices; (18) parent/volunteer-teacher interaction; (19) teacher problems; (20) teacher exit interview data; (21) the impact of reducing class size on cost effectiveness; (22) estimates of the magnitudes of the differences for kindergarten through grade three; and (23) conclusions. A fact sheet on the study emphasizes that the smaller classes made the highest scores on the Stanford Achievement Test and Basic Skills First Test in all four years (K-3) and in all locations (rural, suburban, urban, and inner-city). Teachers must have particular characteristics and possess certain skills for class size reduction to be optimally cost effective. Thirteen tables supplement the text. (RH)

AB  - Available data and recently developed estimation methods make it possible to assess school performance in terms of a production process, where "inputs" of students, teachers, and resources are combined to create a very important "output": the cognitive skills of students. This paper estimates the education production function using representative samples of middle-school students in 15 West European countries. The size of teaching classes is a particularly important feature of the educational production process because it can be relatively easily manipulated by policy makers. However, no statistically and economically significant class-size effect is detected by any of the evidence considered in this paper. The results suggest that, at least in the context of the resources and organizational structure of West European lower secondary education systems, expensive across-the-board reduction of class sizes is extremely unlikely to foster student learning

AB  - This article focuses on early education childhood programs for children in the U.S. According to studies, children's success or failure during the first years of school often predicts how well they will perform in later school years. The No Child Left Behind Act has increased the attention given to closing achievement gaps among school-age children, which as studies have shown, are evident before they even enter kindergarten. Well-prepared and well-compensated teachers, small class sizes, a high teacher-to-pupil ratio and attention to cognitive development are some of the characteristics that successful early childhood programs have in common. These programs must be available to all children, especially those who are in need

AB  - Responds to the comments by L. A. Shepard (see record [rid]2009-13475-005[/rid]) on the current authors' original article (see record [rid]2009-13475-003[/rid]), which sought to support the claim that improvements in student achievement can be linked to the use of assessment information by offering a framework within which to consider evidence-based claims that assessment information can be used to improve student achievement. In this response, the current authors take the opportunity to extend the arguments and examples offered in their original article. They first address the usefulness of the framework for evaluating the validity of formative claims, next explain the motivation for the example of cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA), and conclude with a plea to discontinue use of the phrase 'formative assessment.'

AB  - Purpose: to characterize student performance in Frequency Pattern Test (FPT) and Duration Pattern Test (DPT) in a silent ambient and under noise. Method: experimental cross-sectional study, measured in a convenience sample. Survey made up by 70 students who answered a form on their noise perception. School's noise level was evaluated using physical measurements. Students were submitted to previous evaluations (speech, language, and auditory processing) and then splinted into two groups (G1 - with no Speech-language pathology alteration; G2 - with Speech-language pathology alteration). Students were also submitted to Frequency and Duration Pattern Tests (in silence under noise). Results: school's sound pressure level ranged from 57.2 dBA in school's computer lab to 83.6 dBA in school's gym. According to students, what interferes most in their activities is the buzz from conversations during class. Regarding FPT and DPT, it was possible to note that score average in a quiet environment was higher than under noise. G1 had better performance in the FPT and DPT than G2. Noise worsened in both groups (G1 and G2) as for the performance in tests. Conclusion: school's sound pressure levels are high and out of standard recommendations under the Brazilian national norms. Noise worsened both group performances in FPT and DPT.

Metodo: trata-se de estudo experi­mental transversal, com amostra de conveniência, composta por 70 estudantes, que responderam a um formulário de percepção do ruído ambiental. O nível de ruído da escola foi avaliado com medidor de nível de pressão sonora. Os estudantes foram submetidos à avaliações (fala, motricidade orofa­cial, linguagem e simplificada do processamento auditivo) e distribuídos em dois grupos (G1 sem alteração fonoaudiológica e G2 com alteração fonoaudiológica). Foram realizados também os testes de padrão tonal de frequência e duração (silêncio e ruído). Resultados: o nível médio de pressão sonora da escola variou de 57,2 dB(A) na sala de informática a 83,6 dB(A) na quadra de esportes. Segundo os estudantes, o que mais interfere em suas atividades é o barulho de conversas durante a aula. Quanto aos testes de padrão tonal de frequência (TPF) e duração (TPD), observou-se que a média de acertos no ambiente silencioso foi maior que no ambiente ruidoso. O G1 apresentou melhor desempenho no TPD e TPF que G2. No ruído houve piora no desempenho dos dois grupos (G1 e G2) nos testes. Conclusão: os níveis de pressão sonora da escola encontram-se elevados e fora do padrão recomendado pelas normas nacionais. No ruído, houve piora no desempenho dos testes nos dois grupos estudados.

AB  - This report is one of a series presenting findings from "Prospects: The Congressionally Mandated Study of Educational Growth and Opportunity." This study, conducted in response to the 1988 Hawkins-Stafford Amendments, was a major effort to examine the effects of Chapter 1 on student achievement and other school-related educational outcomes. Data were collected during school years 1991-1994 from nationally representative samples of students from grades 1, 3, and 7 in an initial sample of about 400 schools. An essential finding of an interim report was that Chapter 1, as it was configured in 1991 and 1992, was insufficient to close the gap in academic achievement between Chapter 1 students and their more advantaged peers. In the period covered by this study, the achievement gap remained a reality. There were some highly disadvantaged schools in which children performed better than students in other high-poverty schools, and these were characterized by school-wide Chapter 1 programs; greater use of tracking by ability; more experienced principals; lower rates of student and teacher mobility; a balanced emphasis on remediation and higher-order thinking in classroom instruction; and higher levels of community, parent, and teacher support for the school's mission. Chapter 1 did serve the students most in need of help, but its assistance was insufficient to close the achievement gap. This is not to say that Chapter 1 was not helpful, but it was not enough to bring its students up to par. Data from the Prospects study support earlier research findings that the characteristics of the individual student and family account for the largest part of the variation in student achievement as measured by test scores, but that schools do make an important contribution that can be enhanced. Three appendixes present characteristics of low and high poverty schools, characteristics of high-performing high-poverty schools, and a description of the Technical and Stakeholder Work Group for the study.

AB  - Investigated the comparative effectiveness of the Formative Treatment Strategy (FTS), the Feedback via Formative Tests (FFT) procedure, and the traditional teaching method in teaching mathematics in Jordan. 450 male and female 8th-grade preparatory students from schools in Amman and Irbid were divided into 3 groups and tested with the 3 different methods. Results show that the FTS is superior to the other methods, resulting in higher scores with a gain of 30% over the traditional method, and with review taking only 20% more class time. There was no difference in attitudes toward mathematics between FTS and FFT Ss. The FTS is recommended for use in improving mathematics classes in Jordan.

AB  - The proper assessment of math computational skills is essential for monitoring progress, predicting achievement, and identifying students with disabilities. The current study extends previous research on assessment of curriculum-based measurement in mathematics(M-CBM) . The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of the M-CBM computation assessment on improving third-grade math achievement. This paper presents a comparison study of two classrooms; one used a M-CBM computation in addition to the summative assessment and one used summative assessment only. Each class consisted of 35 students; three who had a Specific Learning Disability in math. The results of a 15-week CBM process demonstrated the effectiveness of using the M-CBM with third- grade students. Furthermore, when compared to the traditional way of assessment, the use of the M-CBM produced significant gains in students'achievement, specifically, for the students who were struggling with math.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the Curriculum Based Measurement of Spelling (CBM-S) and direct spelling instruction on students’ achievement in spelling. A total sample of 95 third-grade students participated in the study. This article presents a comparison study of three classrooms: CBM-S and direct spelling instruction, CBM-S with no direct spelling instruction, and a control group that used the traditional way of spelling assessment. The intervention was implemented for 18 weeks. The results indicated that students achieved the greatest gains in spelling when both direct spelling instruction and the CBM-S were applied.

AB  - This study was undertaken to test whether frequent quizzing would have different learning outcomes with the different populations within the classroom. Normalized mean learning gains were compared among classes that were quizzed or not quizzed. Allied Health Honors, Allied Health Academic and Academic classes in a high school biology classroom were given pre- and posttests in three units of study: protein synthesis, genetics, and classification. The same student population was also analyzed based on academic achievement levels: high, medium and low. In each unit, the experimental group was taught with traditional power point based lectures and guided notes, laboratories, activities, frequent questioning, and post-lecture quizzes. The control group was instructed with the same methods but did not complete the post-lecture quizzes but was allowed independent study time in the classroom to account for class time when the experimental group was quizzing. Pretest, posttest, learning gains, and effect size were calculated across each class type and achievement level. All quizzed populations had a higher normalized learning gain than their non-quizzed counterparts in every unit. Even though the differences were not always statistically different, the student populations were positively affected by frequent quizzing. Frequent quizzing is an effective tool to increase learning in student populations in general, despite any differences in motivation or achievement. Further study with more groups of students may lead to a better understanding of how frequent quizzing impacts the learning of different student populations.

AB  - Learners can experience difficulties to form a mental model of a complex skill and what its mastery implicates in terms of actual behavior. Text-based analytic rubrics can support training and formative assessment of complex skills. However, they lack (1) contextual information needed to convey real-world attributes (2) sensor-motoric information (such as gesturing in the complex skill of presenting) (3) procedural information needed to support the automation of (sub)skills. Text-based analytic rubrics deficiencies for skill-mastery can be remedied by adding video-modeling examples with embedded self-explanation prompts, turning text-based analytic rubrics (TR) into so-called 'video-enhanced analytic rubrics' (VERS). The current study contrasts two experimental conditions (TR, n = 54; VERS, n = 49) for fostering the growth of learners' mental model of complex skills. This was done using the formative assessment supporting Viewbrics online tool and one control condition with a secondary school's current approach for skills-development (without rubrics nor Viewbrics-formative assessment (n = 50)). We measured learners' mental models at three times during their project work by assessing the richness of their constructed concept maps. A multilevel regression analysis showed that learners in the VERS condition form richer mental models when compared to the control condition for most complex skills. • We designed an online formative assessment methodology, with textual rubrics and the video-enhanced rubrics. • 1377 open concept maps captured the mental model development of 3 complex skills. • The video-enhanced rubric condition enriched mental models for 2 out of 3 complex skills.

AB  - Learners in the process of developing complex skills need a rich mental model of what such skills entail. Textual analytics rubrics (TR) are a widely used instrument to support formative assessment of complex skills, supporting feedback, reflection, and thus mental model development of complex skills. However, the textual nature of a rubric limits the possibility to deliver contextual and dynamic (time‐and behaviour‐oriented) information. In the Viewbrics online tool, we developed a version supporting the delivery of contextual and dynamic information by adding video‐modelling examples with embedded self‐explanation prompts to textual analytics rubrics. We called this combination as video‐enhanced rubrics (VERs). Our current study investigates whether the Viewbrics online tool supports complex skills development and whether either textual‐ or video‐enhanced rubrics best support complex skills' mastery. The study was a three‐group (VERS n = 49, TR n = 54, control n = 50) within‐subjects design. Learners' performance of complex skills was measured through expert, peer, and self‐assessment using the Viewbrics online tool. A multilevel regression analysis shows learners in the TR and VERS conditions consistently outperforming the control condition to varying degrees across skills. However, no differences have been found between the two experimental conditions. Positive results across different complex skills indicate the Viewbrics online tool can be used to support the development of a wide range of complex skills in secondary education. Lay Description: Known about the subject matter: The acquisition of cross‐curricular complex skills such is crucial for pupils in secondary education.It is important that students and teachers develop a concrete and consistent picture of (aspects of) these so‐called 21st century skills in order to streamline both their acquisition.Textual rubrics may still have room for improvement, as many aspects of desired behavior can hardly be put into words.Many schools in secondary education are struggling with how to teach and assess cross‐curricular skills. What their paper adds to this: So, we designed a online (online) formative assessment methodology, with textual rubrics and the video‐enhanced rubrics.And measured complex skill performance in two secondary, pre‐university education schools for 24 weeks and compared with existing educational practice.Both experimental groups perform significantly better in the three complex skills compared to the control group.However, the video‐enhanced group did not outperform the textual rubric group. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Supporting the formative assessment of complex skills is a recommendable activity for practitioners, that will likely bear fruit.However, incorporating video modeling examples into an online assessment methodology does not result in improvement in complex skill mastery.

AB  - This study examines the effects of adoption of ACT® Aspire® Periodic Assessments on student academic growth, as measured by the ACT Aspire Summative Assessments. A difference-in-difference analysis shows that adoption of the ACT Aspire Interim Assessments leads to improvements in academic growth. Averaging results across all subject areas and grade levels, adoption typically led to an increase in student growth of 1.3 student growth percentile units, which is comparable to moving from the 50th percentile of school growth to the 56th percentile of school growth. The effect of adoption was strongest for English (+2.9 growth percentile units), followed by science (+1.4 growth percentile units) and math (+1.1 growth percentile units). For reading, effects of adoption were inconsistent across grade levels.

AB  - Examined the frequency of testing as it affects junior secondary school students' performances on social studies examinations. 16 teachers answered a questionnaire. The results revealed a significant difference in the performances of the students based on such variables as frequently tested vs non-frequently tested students, urban vs rural schools, students with quick feedback on tests vs their counterparts without quick feedback. Recommendations for regular classroom tests, small class size and periods per teacher, quick feedback on tests and regular monitoring of progressive tests are suggested as the ways to improve learning outcomes.

AB  - A considerable number of studies on formative teacher assessment and feedback, learner self- and peer-assessment have been carried out in the field of Language Testing and Assessment (LTA) research over the last two decades. These studies investigated the above mentioned concepts from different perspectives (impact of assessment on learning, attitudes towards assessment, comparison between teacher and learner assessment practices, types and quality of formative teacher feedback), in a number of different contexts (English as second language classrooms, mainstream classrooms, immersion classrooms, i.e. for mainstream classrooms, teaching and learning is done through the medium of a second or additional language) and in a number of different ways (experimental studies, observational studies, surveys, research review studies). This paper systematically reviews most the recent research on formative teacher assessment and feedback, learner self- and peer-assessment, and reveals the gaps which have not yet been addressed by the research.

AB  - When retrieval practice is applied in classroom settings, do K-12 students experience changes in test anxiety? To answer this question frequently asked by educators, we surveyed 1408 middle school and high school students about their study strategy preferences and their reactions to a classroom-based program of retrieval practice. For classes in which retrieval practice occurred, 92% of students reported that retrieval practice helped them learn and 72% reported that retrieval practice made them less nervous for unit tests and exams. This study is the first to examine the relationship between retrieval practice and classroom test anxiety, and self-reported study strategy use in pre-college students. In light of our results, we encourage K-12 teachers to use retrieval practice in their classrooms to reduce test anxiety and improve learning.

AB  - Math Works is the fifth grade component of the "Mathematics for the '80s" project, a series of 28 video programs and related material developed by a consortium of state and provincial education and television agencies. A formative evaluation of Math Works programs (9 and 25) was conducted to assess the instructional effectiveness and general appeal of these and other programs in the Math Works series. For Math Works Program 9 ("The Difference between Perimeter and Area"), the sample consisted of more than 400 children, principally fifth graders, in ten schools. For Program 25 ("Dividing Regions into Subregions for Finding Area"), the sample consisted of 107 boys and 83 girls, principally fifth graders from eight schools. Both samples included rural, suburban, and innercity schools. Qualitative data were used primarily to assess the appeal of the programs and to determine needed instructional enhancement; pre- and posttests were used to measure the instructional effectiveness of the programs. T-tests were performed to determine whether student performance significantly increased from the pretest to the posttest. Results indicate: (1) after each program, students' feelings toward mathematics were virtually unchanged; (2) students liked both programs slightly more than they liked mathematics; (3) students fared well on items related only to story line (91.8% correct), although their performance declined on items which asked them to recall the application of a concept within a story (41% correct); (4) results of analysis of variance for sex were inconclusive; and (5) students could identify with the characters in the story, but felt that some dramatic segments were confusing or unrealistic. Appendices contain a list of cooperating agencies, program summaries, and the pre- and posttests. (JB)

AB  - Problem-solving and mathematical communication are essential skills needed by students in learning mathematics. However, empirical evidence reports that students' skills are less satisfying. Thus, this study aims to improve students' problem-solving and mathematical communication skills using a Metacognitive-Based Contextual Learning (MBCL) model. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design was used in this study. The participants were 204 fifth-grade students; consisting of experimental (n = 102) and control (n = 102) groups selected using convenience sampling. This study was conducted in four Indonesian elementary schools in the first semester of the academic year 2019/2020. The Problem-Solving Skills Test (PSST) and Mathematical Communication Skills Test (MCST) were used as pre- and post-tests. In order to analyze the data, one-way ANOVA was used at the 0.05 significance level. The results showed that students in the experimental group had higher post-test scores than the control group in terms of problem-solving and mathematical communication skills. It can be concluded that the MBCL effectively promotes fifth-grade students' problem-solving and mathematical communication skills. Therefore, it is suggested that MBCL should be used more frequently in primary school mathematics to further improve students' problem-solving and mathematical communication skills.

AB  - The popularity of formative assessment has increased since the publication of work by Black and Wiliam in 1998. Even though it is a useful teaching tool, in most cases it has only been possible to use it for students with high levels of cognitive and communicative ability. The aim of this article is to propose a modified, personalisable model of formative assessment for non‐verbal students with autism and severe learning difficulties. Five students with autism and severe learning difficulties participated in systematic video observations over a period of eight weeks, during which student behaviour and attainment were recorded. The behaviour checklist gave an accurate representation of the students' level of engagement and predicted attainment, but differences in passive learning objectives (those requiring passive co‐operation) and active ones (those requiring active contribution) were noted. The introduction of engaging resources improved engagement, but tangible rewards had a negative effect on attainment. Praise had a positive effect on engagement and attainment.

AB  - The role of gender, handwriting automaticity, reading proficiency, and verbal working memory in grade 4 and 5 students. (N = 42; 23 boys) performance on a curriculum-based measure of narrative writing was examined. Three outcomes were measured: total words written, correct minus incorrect word sequences (accurate production of spelling and grammar in-text), and composition quality. Gender (girls > boys) and handwriting automaticity were significant predictors of total words written, and gender (girls > boys), reading proficiency, and grade (5 > 4) significantly predicted correct minus incorrect word sequences scores. Total words written was the only significant predictor of composition quality. The results suggest that reading proficiency and handwriting automaticity should be assessed alongside written expression in order to identify children at risk for writing difficulties and to inform instructional recommendations for these individuals.

AB  - There has been a growing interest among educators over the past few years in formative assessment. Formative assessment, referred to as assessment for learning or assessment as learning, is a planned, ongoing process during which teachers collect information on students' academic performance to enhance the learning and teaching experience and achieve desirable outcomes (Heritage, 2010). It is a low-stakes type of assessment the intent of which is to provide teachers with valuable information about how effectively the instructional approach in place is working and how possibly students can achieve learner autonomy. This research paper aims to determine the effectiveness of employing formative assessment in teaching. Specifically, it investigates whether this type of assessment has a positive impact on the students' motivational drives and their academic achievement. To gauge the effectiveness of formative assessment in students' learning, a few lesson observations were performed by the researcher in the English and Math subjects at Al Ittihad Secondary School. Surveys to and interviews with teachers and students were also carried out, with the intention that the findings would be shared with the teaching staff to improve the school overall performance. One of the key findings of this research is that some teachers could not transfer the ownership of formative assessment to their students. This is due to a tendency on the part of these teachers towards adopting exam-oriented teaching that, according to them, would benefit their students. The research also suggests that some teachers are not well endowed with the principles of formative assessment and according need more training in this field.

AB  - Province-wide results from the Diploma Examinations Program of the Alberta (Canada) schools are presented for the three examinations of the entire 1991-92 school year (January, June, and August). The annual report also provides summaries of results by gender, for population subgroups, and for achievement-over-time studies. School marks, examination marks, and final marks for each course are presented. Examinations are given in English, social studies, French, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics. Results are given for comparison purposes for school years 1989-90 and 1990-91. In 1991-92, 24,873 students took the examination for English 30, the largest number written for any single course. Final marks in the diploma examination courses show that over 85 percent of the students achieved the acceptable standard or higher in each course. In most courses, a high percentage of students achieved the standard of excellence. Section 5 of this report presents a special study on enrollment and achievement. Results indicate that a high participation rate does not, of itself, fully account for low student achievement when it occurs. Results and comparative information are summarized in 31 figures and 36 tables. (SLD)

AB  - This paper aimed at examining the claim that short-stories prepared for preschool children contain a theory-based system which could be reflected on early lexical development. Besides, we investigated the claim that word-class frequency and/or occurrence could be used as a predictor for a child's early lexical development based on views from behaviourism, the frequency hypothesis and ZIPF's law. The correlational approach was followed to measure the two identified variables, namely, simulated early lexical development (represented by preschool materials) as the dependent variable and word-class frequency and/or occurrence (with and without repetition/ frequency) as the independent variable. A series of short-story consisting of ten short-stories was analysed in terms of word-class into eight word-classes and then into different semantic categories. The use of Minitab (17th) version yet running both descriptive and inferential statistical tools indicated that the calculated percentage of the content words were clearly higher than those of the function words (43%, 5%, 6%, 26% and 6%) as compared to only (5%, 8% and 1%) respectively. Moreover, Pearson's product-moment correlation indicated a strong yet positive correlation between word-class frequency and/or occurrence and simulated early lexical development, r= 0.965, p <.0005. Similarly, independent t-test result further indicated that word-class with repetition has statistically significantly higher early lexical development rate (378 +/- 438) compared to word-class without repetition (99 +/- 111), t(7) = 1.72, p = 0.130. Based on our presented results, it could be concluded that short-stories prepared for preschool children contained a theorybased system which could be reflected on early lexical developmentsupported by the fact that there was a clear word-class classification and systematised system for the distribution of word-class in terms of content words (over majority) and function words (minor representation) yet semantic categorisation. Also, word-class frequency and/or occurrence could be used as a predictor simulating child's early lexical development-supported with the reached strong positive correlation between the two correlated variables.

AB  - Purpose: This study, a post hoc observational one, attempted to determine if career and technical education (CTE) students in the state of Mississippi would academically benefit from taking multiple formative assessments in an online format prior to completing their summative exams. Most CTE students in the state of Mississippi are required to take an end-of-course exam cataloged as the Mississippi Career and Planning Assessment System (MS-CPAS). Previously, MS-CPAS test score results did not impact school-wide accountability scores, but in recent years, some of the guidelines were changed so that these summative test scores now play a vital role in school accountability and rankings. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines both formative and summative online exam scores for more than 13,000 students who have taken an MS-CPAS assessment in the 2018 and 2019 school years. Findings: The results of this study revealed that there were significant differences in summative exam scores for students who took two online formative practice tests when compared to groups of students who did not take any formative practice tests. This study also illustrated a positive correlation between those students' final online practice test scores and their summative exam scores. Originality/value: These results would prove very beneficial to both CTE teachers and directors in helping them understand the benefits of introducing formative practice tests into their programs to boost student understanding.

AB  - Continuous classroom assessment is a part and parcel of the teaching learning process. Information generated by these assessments has formative, diagnostic as well as summative functions. This assumes that the items used in the assessment tasks possess the necessary qualities that render the tasks valid and reliable. The paper presents the role of continuous classroom assessment in shape of tests and assignments in academic achievement of students at elementary level in English language. A total of 60 students were randomly assigned as either the experimental or the control group and were pre-and post-tested to determine their academic achievements before and after the treatment. The experimental group was continuously assessed through tests and assignments, while control group did not receive any such type of treatment. Results were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and t-test. From the findings it was observed that the use of continuous classroom assessment in shape of tests and assignments enhanced achievement in English language. The significant difference favoring those continuously assessed with the help of tests and assignments as assessment tools. While it is demonstrated that continuous classroom assessment has an important role in student's achievement. The results of this study could help elementary education institutions to enrich the assessment process of students through weekly tests and daily assignments. It is recommended that Small group activities especially in this part of the world with large class size can be easily assessed. In schools and even with examination bodies, younger students who are not highly verbal and who are better suited to action tests should always be assessed through written tests.

AB  - Validity and reliability of scores obtained on Multiple-choice questions (MCQs), as well as the benefits of test-enhanced learning, have been of interest to medical educator scholars. Presented in this dissertation are four composite studies on these themes. The following hypotheses were tested: 1. Increased MCQ distractor functioning increases the validity and reliability of obtained scores. 2. Correction of item writing flaws (along with enhancement of tested cognitive level) and replacement or removal of non-functioning distractors equally improves psychometric characteristics of MCQs. 3. Repeated testing via free-response items enhances the retention of knowledge of human anatomy, compared with repeated or once-testing via multiple-choice questions. Validity and reliability of scores obtained on MCQs was noted to rise as a result of increased MCQ distractor functioning, discrimination amongst high and low performing students was found to be equally improved via removal of flaws and non-functioning distractors, and short-term (up to four weeks) retention of human anatomy knowledge was found to be enhanced by repeated testing via free-response questions. Raising MCQ quality by addressing flaws and low distractor functioning, and using no-stakes repeated retrieval practice, is advised for improvement in the assessment and learning practices in pre-clinical medical education.

AB  - The current study investigated the effects of peer-mediated goal setting and feedback on curriculum-based measurement indices of written expression. Participants were 106 students in six 5th-grade classrooms completed bi-weekly writing probes and classrooms were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition. Students in the experimental group received peer-mediated goal setting and feedback and students in the control condition did not receive any information regarding performance or goals. The results revealed that students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control condition on the Total Words Written index over time. The results also indicated that students in the experimental classrooms had significantly higher rates of growth on the Total Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, and Correct Writing Sequences indices. Rates of growth for the Percentage of Words Spelled Correctly, Percentage of Correct Writing Sequences, and Correct Minus Incorrect Writing Sequences indices were similar. The current study also found that students in the experimental classrooms had significantly higher final performance scores than those in control classrooms on the Total Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, Correct Writing Sequences, and Correct Minus Incorrect Writing Sequences indices. Finally, results of the current study indicated that teachers indicated high levels of acceptability for peer-mediated interventions in the area of written expression when compared to interventions that fail to provide any feedback to students.

AB  - This study explored the use of common formative assessments and their potential to increase student achievement in mathematics as measured by standardized tests. A problem of instructional reform in the United States has been to find and consistently apply a methodology pertinent to all school systems and grade levels that meets the objectives of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2002, known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), while also improving classroom instruction. Practices such as block scheduling, professional learning communities (PLCs), as well as instructional reform practices have been mandated by the federal government in order to meet its objectives for low-performing, Title-1 schools. One best practice recommended by NCLB is the use of common formative assessments. This study examined how students' standardized test scores in mathematics changed since the introduction of common formative assessments and how these changes compare with changes in test scores in the other core subject areas. This quantitative case study used a t-test, linear regression analysis, and ANOVA to compare achievement scores of 2 cohorts. One cohort participated in a school-wide common formative assessment practice aligned with the California Standards Test. The means of the 2 cohorts were compared to determine whether in-house common assessment scores positively correlated with students' California Standards Test scores. This study also inquired into the correlation between common formative assessments with regard to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and the increased proficiency in mathematics as measured by the California Standards Test, a correlation relevant to all educators—particularly those school sites with a population of English Language Learners and students who qualify for free or reduced priced lunch. The findings of this study determined common formative assessments: (a) correlate positively with scores on the California Standards Test, (b) are vehicles that allow socioeconomically disadvantaged students to increase their performance on the California Standards Test, and (b) encourage teachers' to modify their instruction. In addition, the findings of this study supported a need to suggest improvements to the current program in order to increase the effectiveness of common formative assessments.

AB  - This manuscript describes two empirical studies of alternative scoring procedures used with curriculum-based measurement in writing (CBM-W). Study 1 explored the technical adequacy of a trait-based rubric in first grade. Study 2 explored the technical adequacy of a trait-based rubric, production-dependent, and production-independent scores in third grade. Results of Study 1 suggest that the rubric holds promise as a valid measure of sentence writing ability in first grade and has utility as a supplemental scoring procedure when using CBM-W as a screening tool. Results of Study 2 show that correct word sequences maintained the highest correlation coefficients across time with the trait-based rubric, but the other scoring procedures might offer promise as reliable alternative scoring methods. However, high internal correlations among the text features of the rubric along with highly variable interrater reliability suggest that caution must be taken in interpreting results.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate evidence of reliability, criterion validity, and grade-level differences of curriculum-based measures of writing (CBM-W) with 612 students in grades 1–3. Four scoring procedures (words written, words spelled correctly, correct word sequences, and correct minus incorrect word sequences) were used with two CBM-W tasks (picture–word and story prompt) during fall, winter, and spring of one academic year. A subsample of participants (n = 244) were given a criterion measure in spring of the academic year. Pearson’s r coefficients were calculated to determine evidence of alternate form reliability and criterion validity, and a MANOVA was used to detect significant growth within and across grade levels. Results indicated that scores on both CBM-W tasks had adequate reliability and validity coefficients in grades 2–3 and mixed results in grade 1. Significant growth was detected within and across all grades at each time point on each task. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - The differential effects of two types of follow-up support (self-monitoring and consultation) on teachers' use of a data-based instruction system and student achievement in mathematics computation were investigated. Special education teachers monitored the progress of two students with mild disabilities in math computation with curriculum-based measurement (CBM). Of 18 teachers, 8 received university-based consultation bimonthly; 10 teachers self-monitored their use of CBM. Results indicated that students in both groups made comparable, significant achievement in math computation. Furthermore, the degree of implementation of CBM was similar for teachers in both groups. Implications for instructional consultation for teachers using data-based instruction such as CBM, and recommendations for additional research are discussed.

AB  - Examined the effect of differential implementation of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) on math computation achievement of students with mild disabilities, and explored teacher characteristics and school organizational factors related to the quality of teacher CBM implementation. 29 special education teachers each used CBM for 16 wks to monitor 2 3rd–6th grade students with mild disabilities in math computation. Results indicate that students whose teachers implemented CBM more accurately made the most significant math gains. Teachers who implemented CBM with less quality did not effect better growth than control teachers, indicating that partial CBM implementation is not beneficial. Adequacy of planning time was associated with the quality of CBM implementation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This technical report describes the development of fifth grade progress monitoring measures in the area of Passage Reading Fluency. This measure was designed to target the fluency component of a developmental model of reading. Twenty alternate forms were written by graduate students and reviewed by the lead author. The passages were piloted and mean scores were compared as a measure of difficulty. In response to these data, the passages were brought into closer alignment by identifying nine passages that showed similar difficulty level and adjusting the remaining passages to match this level. Data on the difficult of each passage and a summary of revisions are presented. Appended are: (1) Test Specifications for Creating Passage Reading Fluency Measures; (2) Example Fifth Grade Passage Reading Fluency Test: Student Copy; and (3) Example Fifth-Grade Passage Reading Fluency Test: Assessor Copy.

AB  - In this technical report, we describe the development and piloting of a series of mathematics progress monitoring measures intended for use with students in kindergarten. These measures, available as part of easyCBM[TM], an online progress monitoring assessment system, were developed in 2008 and administered to approximately 2800 students from schools across the United States in March through June of 2009 using a common item design to allow all items to be estimated on the same scale within each grade level. We analyzed the results of the piloting using a one parameter logistic (1PL) Rasch analysis. Because the results of these analyses are quite lengthy, we present the results for each grade's analysis in its own technical report, all sharing a common introduction but unique methods, results, and discussion sections.

AB  - This study was aimed at detecting the most frequently-used teaching and assessment activities in secondary school science classes, identifying links between these variables, and revealing possible challenges in these processes. To this end, data were gathered from 155 secondary school science teachers in 56 Israeli public schools and 380 grade eight and nine students from 22 of these using the What Is Happening In this Class? Teachers were also asked to indicate their perceptions of the extent to which they used formative assessment tasks provided by the curriculum and to specify, in their own words, the reason for insufficient usage of these tasks. Task orientation was highly used in science classes, whereas investigation was the least employed activity, according to both teachers' and students' perceptions. The most-frequently used tasks to evaluate students were final tests and quizzes. Path model analysis revealed that teachers who tended to use teacher-based approaches also employed traditional assessment tools, whereas teachers who allowed students to cooperate rather than compete with one another tended to use formative assessment tools. Implications limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Every-grade, every-year testing plays a prominent part in U.S. education policy and research, but the rise of standardized testing has been met with frustration and opposition. In response, policymakers have proposed legislation designed to curb the amount of standardized testing. There is little empirical evidence, however, about the potential impact of these alternate approaches on current evaluation systems. Using data from a large, urban school district, we compare value-added (VA) estimates from every-year, every-grade testing to those from two reduced-testing scenarios. We find marginal changes in the value-added estimates in both approaches relative to more traditional VA estimates. Estimates from annual testing in alternating subjects are slightly less precise but have lower associations with prior student achievement than biennial testing in both subjects. Further, there is significant decrease in the number of teachers for whom scores can be estimated in both approaches, exacerbating long-standing concerns with VA methodology.

AB  - Understanding the difference between summative and formative assessments is still unclear for many teachers and principals as well as the effects formative assessments have on student learning outcomes. This quantitative study was conducted to explicitly explore formative assessments as a means to improve student learning outcomes, while examining the different types of formative assessments teachers use in the classroom in three southern California schools in grades three through six, as measured by student Lexile reading scores, presents opportunity for growth. The correlational research design method was used involving a teacher survey and the Renaissance Learning "STAR Reading" assessment to measure student growth in reading to teacher's use of formative assessments in the classroom. The survey data from the teacher survey was put into an excel file before being imported into the IBM SPSS software. The correlational research tests for a statistical relationship between variables. This study measures both variables to check to see if they are in fact related. The research questions were designed to seek information about teachers' experiences and beliefs about formative assessments. The results from the study are designed to inform the participating district on what specific professional learning is needed to support teachers with the implementation of formative assessments.

AB  - Three important features to examine for measures used to systematically monitor progress over time are (a) technical features of static scores, (b) technical features of slope, and (c) instructional utility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical features of slope of four early numeracy curriculum-based measures administered to kindergarten students. Approximately 200 students were assessed at the beginning and end of the school year, and a subset of students (n = 55) was assessed three additional times during the year. Growth curve analysis was used to model growth over time. The contribution of slope to explaining variance on a criterion measure was examined for the curriculum-based measures that fit a linear growth pattern. Implications are discussed regarding monitoring progress in early mathematics.

AB  - Testing is the most common way to assess student learning at all ages and grade levels. Testing is traditionally viewed as a measure of knowledge, and not as a way to enhance learning. Nonetheless, a large body of literature demonstrates that testing is actually an effective way to facilitate learning and enhance long-term memory for information. This finding, that retrieval of information from memory leads to better retention than re-studying or re-reading the same information, has been termed the testing effect. The benefit of testing compared to review of material is typically seen after a delay between practice and final test, with review being a better strategy when the test is given immediately or after a short delay. This phenomenon has been shown across a variety of contexts, test formats, retention intervals, and ranges of ages and abilities. However, one domain in which the testing effect has not been shown to work is in the review of student-produced lecture notes. Lecture note-taking is a ubiquitous learning strategy and notes have been shown to be highly correlated with academic outcomes such as test performance and GPA. Note-taking in itself is a cognitively demanding process, and students often struggle to take accurate and complete notes from lecture, thus limiting the benefits of note-taking and review. There is limited research on ways to improve the review function of notes. Thus, this dissertation sought to understand the effect of integrating the testing effect into the context of lecture note-taking on memory for information compared to review of notes and a lecture-only control.A sample of 59 high school students watched a video lecture and took notes on the information. The lecture was divided into three sections with two-minute pauses in between each segment. During each pause, students were asked to either reread their notes from the previous section (review group), recall and write down what they remembered to be the most important ideas from the lecture they were just shown (self-testing group), or complete a distractor word search puzzle for the duration of the pause (lecture-only control group). Participants were given a written recall test of lecture information following a one-day delay. Comparisons were made between lecture groups on test performance and note quantity. Measures of sustained attention and mind-wandering during lecture were examined as covariates.While participants in the self-testing group scored higher on the written recall test, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Self-testing and reviewing notes during lecture pauses were both significantly better than lecture note-taking alone. Results also showed that it was actually the students in the review group who took significantly more notes than those in the lecture-only control. There was a main effect for time, indicating that students in all lecture groups took increasingly more notes as the lecture progressed. Note quantity was found to be a significant predictor of test performance. Examination of attentional variables showed that students who reported lower instances of mind-wandering took significantly more notes and did significantly better on the recall test. Further, students in the self-testing group reported less of an increase in mind-wandering as the lecture progressed compared to those in the control group.Differences between the results of this study and other studies in the testing effect literature are hypothesized to be due several factors, including complexity of lecture information, encoding difficulties, and the presentation of new information at each self-testing time point. Future research should continue to explore the testing effect in conjunction with note taking. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evidence suggests that adapting teaching responsively to pupil assessment can be effective in improving students' learning. However, existing studies tend to be small-scale, leaving unanswered the question of how such formative assessment can operate when embedded as standard practice. In this study, we present the results of a randomized trial conducted in 140 English secondary schools. The intervention uses light-touch training and support, with most of the work done by teacher-led teaching and learning communities within schools. It is, therefore, well-suited to widespread adoption. In our pre-registered primary analysis, we estimate an effect size of 0.09 on general academic attainment in national, externally assessed examinations. Sensitivity analysis, excluding schools participating in a similar program at baseline, and complier analysis both suggest a larger effect size of 0.11. These results are encouraging for this approach to improving the implementation of formative assessment and, hence, academic attainment. Our findings also suggest that the intervention may help to narrow the gap between high and low prior attainment pupils, although not the gap between those from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest of the cohort.

AB  - This study details an innovative approach to coordinating and enhancing multiple levels of assessment and discursive feedback around an existing multi-media curricular environment called Astronomy Village®. As part of a broader design-based research programme, the study analysed small group interactions in feedback activities across two design cycles. The goal of this analysis is to develop an understanding of the ways that a situative approach to assessment and practise supports learning. Findings demonstrate ways that student and teacher engagement in collaborative activities support and constrain meaningful understanding, which we consider in terms of a trajectory of participation in and across conversations and written assessments, as well as individual learning gains on formal classroom examinations and standards-oriented external tests. Analyses of complementary formulations of domain concepts - discourse practises and assessment performance - suggest that participation in social forms of scientific engagement supports both learning and subsequent performance in more formal contexts. We suggest design principles for integrating the formative functions of discursive feedback with the summative functions of traditional assessment, through participation in different forms of science discourse(s).

AB  - This action research thesis was performed to explore the research questions: How did the use of formative assessment affect student performance data in understanding the concepts of the Sun-Earth-Moon system?, How did the use of learning scales as formative techniques impact student self-assessment of their knowledge of the Sun-Earth-Moon system?, How did the implementation of formative assessment techniques affect student discourse on the topic of the Sun-Earth-Moon system? Formative assessment techniques including "talk-friendly" probes, sticky bars, and agree-disagree statements were used in the classroom to expose gaps in knowledge, to facilitate discourse, and promote self-assessment. A triangulation of data included a district-provided pre/post-test, teacher observation, written and oral student responses of formative assessment, self-assessment, discourse, and student self-assessment on a learning goal tracker. Data gathered from student responses to formative assessment techniques given during discourse, lab experiences, in written responses, and from the student learning scale tracker were analyzed to expose misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and guide classroom instruction. Data showed that student performance data improved overall and students narrowed gaps in knowledge of the Sun-Earth-Moon system. Improvement in student participation and skill of discourse was evident; however students needed more practice developing written explanations for phenomenon within the Sun-Earth-Moon system. Through the use of self-assessments students showed improvement in ability to self-assess and realized gained knowledge toward their learning goal.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to measure and describe students' learning development in mental computation of mixed addition and subtraction tasks up to 100. We used a learning progress monitoring (LPM) approach with multiple repeated measurements to examine the learning curves of second-and third-grade primary school students in mental computation over a period of 17 biweekly measurement intervals in the school year 2020/2021. Moreover, we investigated how homogeneous students' learning curves were and how sociodemographic variables (gender, grade level, the assignment of special educational needs) affected students' learning growth. Therefore, 348 German students from six schools and 20 classes (10.9% students with special educational needs) worked on systematically, but randomly mixed addition and subtraction tasks at regular intervals with an online LPM tool. We collected learning progress data for 12 measurement intervals during the survey period that was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Technical results show that the employed LPM tool for mental computation met the criteria of LPM research stages 1 and 2. Focusing on the learning curves, results from latent growth curve modeling showed significant differences in the intercept and in the slope based on the background variables. The results illustrate that one-size-fits-all instruction is not appropriate, thus highlighting the value of LPM or other means that allow individualized, adaptive teaching. The study provides a first quantitative overview over the learning curves for mental computation in second and third grade. Furthermore, it offers a validated tool for the empirical analysis of learning curves regarding mental computation and strong reference data against which individual learning growth can be compared to identify students with unfavorable learning curves and provide targeted support as part of an adaptive, evidence-based teaching approach. Implications for further research and school practice are discussed.

AB  - An earlier study showed that the changes in teachers' classroom practice, after participation in a professional development program in formative assessment, significantly improved student achievement in mathematics. The teachers in that study were a random selection of Year 4 teachers in a Swedish mid-sized municipality. In the present study, we analyse and describe the characteristics of these changes in classroom practice, which were based on a combination of various strategies for formative assessment. Data were collected through teacher interviews and classroom observations. The teachers implemented many new activities that strengthened a formative classroom practice based on identifying student learning needs and modifying the teaching and learning accordingly. The characteristics of the changes the teachers made reveal the complexity of this formative assessment practice and why such developments of practice are likely to require major changes in most teachers' practices. We also discuss how such changes in practice afford new learning opportunities.

AB  - The study examined the effects of formative assessment on community college students' content-specific vocabulary skills, academic achievement and academic self-efficacy. Sixty-one community college students who were enrolled in Developmental Psychology took part in formative assessment only (N = 24), formative assessment in conjunction with goal setting and self-monitoring (N = 19) or no formative assessment (N = 20). It was hypothesized that students who took part in formative assessment in conjunction with goal setting and self-monitoring would achieve higher content-specific vocabulary skills, academic achievement and academic self-efficacy from pretest to posttest when compared to students who took part in formative assessment only and no formative assessment. Findings indicated that students in both of the formative assessment groups had significantly higher content-specific vocabulary skills from pretest to posttest when compared to the control group. Implications for formative assessment practices with community college students and the lack of support for the hypotheses are discussed.

AB  - School districts across the United States are implementing or starting to implement Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) to address both academics and behavior. Within this framework, valid instruments are needed to monitor both academic and behavioral progress. Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) can be a very powerful tool to universally screen students and provide a way to monitor academic progress. CBMs are generally short, fluency-based mini-assessments that provide formative data for educational planning and progress monitoring of instruction. While research has been completed in the area of reading CBM, there is a lack of evidence to support the use of mathematics CBM (M-CBM), especially at the secondary level. Research is needed to validate these instruments so they can be used for universal screening and progress monitoring (Hosp, Hosp, & Howell, 2007). M-CBM is one type of assessment that could help teachers improve monitoring of mathematics instruction and could also provide a way to identify students in need of further intervention (Eckert, Dunn, Codding, Begeny, & Kleinmann, 2006). In an effort to obtain data on the criterion validity of secondary M-CBM, screening data were compared to the North Carolina End-of-Grade Mathematics Test (NC EOG Math Test). Correlation coefficients were completed between AIMSweb Math Calculation CBM (M-COMP) and Math Concept and Applications M-CBM (M-CAP). M-COMP and M-CAP were both taken by students at the end of the 2011 - 2012 school year. Students also took the NC EOG Math Test during the same time frame. Correlations were also completed between the M-COMP and M-CAP taken in 2011 - 2012 to the NC EOG Math Test taken at the end of the 2012 - 2013 school year. Results of the study suggest that M-CAP has strong concurrent and predictive validity when the dependent measure is the NC EOG Math Test. The study also provides evidence that calculation skills, while important, do not have strong predictive strength, at the secondary level, when a state math assessment is the criterion. Finally, contrary to the hypothesis, concurrent validity coefficients are not higher than predictive coefficients. Implications related to the field of school psychology and recommendations for further research are discussed

AB  - Prior reviews of evidence for the impact of formative assessment on student achievement suggest widely different estimates of formative assessment's effectiveness, ranging from 0.40 and 0.70 standard deviations in one review. The purpose of this study is to describe variability in the effectiveness of formative assessment for promoting student achievement by refining, updating and applying Black and Wiliam's (1998a) original typology of formative assessment interventions and including only those studies that meet rigorous evidence standards for supporting causal inferences. The systematic evidence review focuses on the effectiveness of formative assessment for improving the academic achievement of students in grades 1-6, including both regular education students and students with learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, and/or intellectual disabilities. Although findings from the study are currently under review, the process of preparing for and responding to reviews of the report posed several challenges and opportunities to consider possible solutions regarding communicating the value of a more precise estimate of formative assessment's effectiveness to practitioners and policy-makers. In conclusion, the formative assessment evidence review provides an opportunity to examine evidence that ordinarily is interpreted as strongly supporting the view that formative assessment is effective for improving student achievement. By extending conceptual frameworks for categorizing types of formative assessments presented in prior reviews and adopting rigorous standards to assess whether studies support causal inferences, this evidence review allows practitioners and researchers to examine relationships between effectiveness and both malleable and non-malleable factors. Figures are appended. [SREE documents are structured abstracts of SREE conference symposium, panel, and paper or poster submissions.]

AB  - This study investigated the effect of weekly progress reports on the academic achievement of seventh grade language arts students. It also investigated the effects of weekly progress reports on locus of control attribution and the relationship between academic achievement and locus of control attribution. The study took place in a suburban school of 1,344 students, 95% of whom were African American. Two seventh grade language arts classes that were equivalent based on standardized tests scores were chosen as treatment and control groups. The comparison group received progress reports at 3-week intervals, but the treatment group received weekly progress reports itemizing the student's score on each assignment. No significant differences were found between the groups for academic achievement or locus of control. Twelve appendixes contain a sample report, the locus of control measure, grade sheets, and statistical data about student achievement and locus of control. (Contains 54 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Early identification of learning difficulties is a critical component of the Response to Intervention (RtI) model. In kindergarten, the screening of foundational reading skills can provide a data-based guideline for identifying students requiring a more intensive response-based intervention before starting elementary school. This study examines the classification accuracy and best predictors of a set of Spanish curriculum-based measures administered during kindergarten. The study's sample included 189 students tested in the fall, winter, and spring. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted. The composite score of the curriculum-based measurement (CBM) revealed area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.83, 0.97, and 0.94 in the fall, winter, and spring, respectively. Phonemic awareness and letter-sound knowledge were the only isolated measures that demonstrated excellent AUC values throughout kindergarten. Logistic regression models showed that, when entered simultaneously, all measures were significant predictors of reading risk at some moment of the school year.

AB  - The authors propose the use of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) to evaluate the effectiveness of the academic and behavioral programming for students with emotional and behavioral disorders. When applied to a problem such as the school failure of students identified as having emotional or behavioral disorders, CBM data regarding the appropriateness of identification as well as the student's performance may reveal important features of effective instructional practices and their effects on students' academic performance. CBM data can help reveal features of practices that increase achievement and reduce failure for students with disabilities and may be particularly effective in addressing problems in the assessment of minority students.

AB  - For more than a decade, Pewaukee School District Superintendent JoAnn Sternke has watched her district get better and better at its mission: opening the door to each student's future. The Wisconsin district began using Measures of Academic Progress® (MAP®) computer adaptive interim assessments from Northwest Evaluation Association™ (NWEA™) in 2004 as a tool to improve student growth. After years of effort by educators, staff, and students to advance academic achievement, Pewaukee School District (PSD) now boasts one of the highest graduation rates in the state. In 2013, they received another tangible marker of success: the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the highest presidential honor given to American organizations for performance excellence. School leadership credits educators' increasingly sophisticated use of high-quality assessment data with improvements in classroom learning and programmatic effectiveness.

AB  - Because students in two Georgia middle schools, Grades 6 through 8, performed poorly in standardized mathematics testing during the 2016-17 school term, the district sought improvements by using the computer-assisted formative assessment tool iLearn. The purpose of this quantitative project study was to determine whether the use of iLearn predicted increased mathematics achievement and to support professional development sessions for teachers to improve their pedagogy. With the theoretical framework of mastery learning theory, the study addressed the effectiveness of iLearn as a formative assessment tool, hypothesizing a positive relationship between iLearn and end-of-grade (EOG) assessment scores; a moderating effect of students’ gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES); and a score difference between students who did and did not use iLearn. Based on a causal-comparative and correlational analysis using archived data from 1,582 students, results indicated that the use of iLearn significantly predicted EOG scores, explaining nearly a quarter of their variance. Ethnicity and SES significantly moderated the relationship between iLearn and EOG scores; however, their moderating effect was too small to count. Finally, iLearn participants had significantly higher EOG scores than nonparticipants, displaying a small to medium effect size. Results showed that iLearn may be used in educational practice as a formative assessment tool regardless of students’ gender, ethnicity, and SES. The project included a professional development plan for teachers who use iLearn in the classroom. This study may be used to increase achievement of middle school students in mathematics.

AB  - This ex post facto, quasi-experimental, quantitative research examined the effectiveness of a weekly progress monitoring program—as multi-tiered support—with sixth through eighth graders who require special education in middle school. Through a pretest-posttest, nonequivalent control group design, the study compared reading improvement on the Jerry Johns Basic Reading Inventory (BRI) and a high-stakes state accountability assessment (MAP-CA) over a four-year period. Additionally, correlation between the BRI and AIMSweb Reading Curriculum-Based Measurement (R-CBM) was computed. According to the BRI, results indicated a significant increase in the reading achievement for students in the treatment group. Notably, no significant difference in scaled scores on the MAP-CA occurred. Calculations defined a strong positive correlation (r=.772) between Lexile scores on the BRI and R-CBM. Limitations that impacted the findings included experimental control over specific reading interventions implemented and teacher styles, tenure, qualifications, and expertise. Furthermore, missing MAP-CA data for eighth-grade students affected results due to the replacement of MAP-CA with end-of-course (EOC) exams in ninth grade. An analysis of complete MAP-CA data for sixth-grade students revealed faster gains in reading for the treatment group. Implications for policy and practice suggest increased use of progress monitoring in middle schools, need for high-quality professional development of educators, importance of data coaching, and continued administration of the BRI in conjunction with R-CBM as formative and summative tools to evaluate reading goals on Individualized Education Programs.

AB  - Researchers have repeatedly showed that when students take a test on the studied materials, their retention of information increases on later exams. The memory gain produced by tests is called the testing effect. The testing effect has been demonstrated with different materials (e.g., word lists, prose), with different designs (e.g., within-subjects, between-subjects), with different age groups and with different settings (e.g., laboratory, classroom). This thesis offers a novel approach to the assessment of the testing effect: the transfer of the testing effect. Although research on the testing effect has been flourishing over the last decade, transfer of the effect has not been studied systematically. In this context, the transfer of the testing effect refers to whether a learner can utilize the memory gain produced by tests in different contexts. The present study examined the transfer of the testing effect in the temporal domain which refers to retention of the testing effect over a period of time (Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3 and Experiment 4), the knowledge domain which refers to transfer of the testing effect across different levels of learning (Experiment 1, Experiment 2 and Experiment 3) and the modality domain which concerns how the format of the tests influence the testing effect (Experiment 4). In addition to the laboratory studies, Experiment 3 was conducted in an actual classroom setting incorporating real classroom curriculum. The study revealed that the testing effect endures over a long period of time varying between 1 and 12 weeks and is transferable across different levels of learning (i.e., lower level and higher level). Furthermore, the testing effect is affected by the differences in the format of tests. The transferability of the testing effect across different domains indicated that the testing effect reflects more than rote learning. The findings of the study were discussed in light of two competing theoretical orientations explaining the testing effect: the retrieval hypothesis and the transfer-appropriate processing framework. Additionally, the practical implications of the study were discussed in relation to the educational system.

AB  - Online assessment of any type is attractive to educators because it allows large amounts of student data to be gathered and accessed quickly. Indeed, online, summative assessments--generally end-of-course, state-level, and placement exams--are making the annual student testing ritual a meaningful audit instead of what some call an "autopsy" because data reports arrive too late to have any impact on student learning. Yet educators now want meaningful data sooner and more regularly to plan instruction and intervention. That's where online, formative assessments come in. In June of 2005, the Appalachia Educational Laboratory (AEL) at Edvantia, Inc., and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) held a one-day symposium prior to CCSSO's National Conference on Large-Scale Assessment. The purpose of the event was to discuss issues related to standards-based, formative assessment delivered online. The Institute for the Advancement of Emerging Technologies in Education (IAETE) at AEL coordinated the symposium. The large number of attendees, as well as their comments throughout the day, clearly indicate that the topic resonated with states and districts; the results of CCSSO surveys of issues important to its membership also indicate great interest in the topic.

AB  - The idea that formative assessments embedded in a curriculum could help guide teachers toward better instructional practices that lead to greater student learning has taken center stage in science assessment research. In order to embed formative assessments in a curriculum, curriculum developers and assessment specialists should collaborate to create these assessment tasks. This article describes the development of the formal embedded formative assessments and implementation plans for the collaborative research study. It describes the fundamental shift away from “summative assessment scripts” to formative assessments lesson scripts. Assessment tasks and implementation plans are described along with the rationale for why these tasks were selected and where these tasks were placed in the curriculum. Finally, we conclude about how to embed formative assessments in new or existing curricula and how to help teachers use these assessments successfully. We point out the critical importance of collaboration and professional development aimed at enabling teachers to re-conceptualize the role of assessments in their teaching, linking formative assessments to overall goals, and providing a learning trajectory as reference for teachers to locate students' ideas in the trajectory and provide feedback accordingly.

AB  - A review of the literature pertaining to the effect and influence of commercially-prepared interim assessments in mathematics and language arts literacy reveals a lack of quantitative data to determine the value of these products for school reform. This study examined the ability of commercially-prepared interim pretest and posttest assessments in language arts literacy (LAL) and math to predict student achievement on the state-mandated summative assessment in those subjects. Analyses were conducted using binary logistic regression models. Data for this study included results from the state-mandated grade 8 assessments (NJ ASK 8) for 291 eighth grade students enrolled in two middle level schools located in a suburban/urban central New Jersey community during the 2009-2010 academic school year. The findings suggest that the predictive value of the students' pretest results is very similar to that of the posttest results and call into question the efficacy of implementing both interim pretests and posttests.

AB  - My personal experience as a teacher in Japan has raised questions about the usefulness of both summative and formative assessment, the possible benefits of non-traditional approaches to classroom instruction, and the influence of assessment measures in the success of Japanese students. For instance, the use of collaborative, inquiry, task or project-based learning in Japanese high schools is nearly non-existent because of the structure of government-led educational standards, which mostly focus on preparing students for university entrance examinations. By critically looking at the latest existing literature on the uses and impact of assessment in Japanese education, this paper aims to further contribute to the discussion on the topic by elucidating possible implications for teachers and researchers who are interested in the context of Japan or similar educational settings. This paper also attempts to look at Japan's current educational practices and how cultural tradition is woven into the integration of teaching philosophy.

AB  - Successive relearning (a combination of retrieval practice and distributed practice) can boost student performance in memory-based knowledge, such as key-term definitions. The current classroom experiments sought to extend this finding to application-based exam questions. As part of students’ coursework, they completed assignments in which they successively relearned class concepts in one of three formats: examples, definitions, or a mix of both. Then, students took course exams containing novel application-based questions about concepts they had successively relearned, as well as business-as-usual concepts that were covered in class lectures but were not included in the successive relearning assignments. Performance on the novel exam questions did not differ between the three successive relearning formats, but students did perform about 10 percentage points higher on concepts they had successively relearned compared to business-as-usual concepts. Thus, successive relearning can improve performance on application-based questions regardless of whether students practice examples or definitions.

AB  - Recent federal mandates and educational advocates emphasize accountability, early intervention, and responsiveness to intervention using continuous, brief assessments in order to improve student outcomes in mathematics. Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) can help meet these directives. Preliminary research suggests that one may use CBM for early identification and intervention with academic problems in mathematics (e.g., Chard et al., 2005; Clarke & Shinn, 2004; Daly, Wright, Kelly, & Martens, 1997; VanDerHeyden et al., 2001; VanDerHeyden et al., 2004; VanDerHeyden, Broussard, & Cooley, 2006). Specifically, reliability and validity data for CBM of early numeracy skills exist. However, there needs to be replication and extension of research in this area. The purpose of this dissertation was to provide information on the sensitivity and long-term predictive validity of early mathematics CBM administered in kindergarten on other direct and teacher-determined measures of mathematics administered in first grade. The study assessed 61 students from kindergarten to first grade. Students completed a set of experimental early numeracy CBMs (Tests of Early Numeracy [TEN]; Clarke & Shinn, 2002) in kindergarten and first grade. The study included additional criterion measures (i.e., mathematics-CBM [M-CBM], report card grades, teacher ratings of mathematics skills, and discipline referral data) in the first grade assessment. Repeated measures ANOVAs explored student growth on the TEN measures. Correlation and regression analyses examined the relationships among the experimental measures and between the experimental and criterion measures. Results indicated significant relationships between kindergarten and first grade TEN performance. In addition, students showed significant growth on all TEN measures from kindergarten to first grade. A measure of kindergarten students' number line skills, missing number, had the most support as a single indicator of first grade outcomes, in particular of first grade computation skills. In addition, it appears that a kindergarten measure of quantity discrimination is an important indicator of first grade teacher-determined outcomes. Preliminary descriptive data showed that students who received no discipline referrals in the first grade generally scored higher on kindergarten TEN than students who received one or more discipline referrals in the first grade.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to characterize and construct universally optimal designs among the class of circular repeated-measurements designs when the parameters do not permit balance for carry-over effects. It is shown that some circular weakly neighbour balanced designs defined by Filipiak and Markiewicz (2012) are universally optimal repeated-measurements designs. These results extend the work of Magda (1980), Kunert (1984b), and Filipiak and Markiewicz (2012).

AB  - First-year students often become discouraged during introductory biology courses when repeated attempts to understand concepts nevertheless result in poor test scores. This challenge is exacerbated by traditional course structures that impose premature judgments on students' achievements. Repeated testing has been shown to benefit student ability to recognize and recall information, but an effective means to similarly facilitate skill with higher-order problems in introductory courses is needed. Here, we show that an innovative format that uses a creative grading scheme together with weekly formative midterm exams produced significant gains in student success with difficult items requiring analysis and interpretation. This format is designed to promote tenacity and avoid discouragement by providing multiple opportunities to attempt demanding problems on exams, detailed immediate feedback, and strong incentives to retain hope and improve. Analysis of individual performance trajectories with heat maps reveals the diversity of learning patterns and provides rational means for advising students.

AB  - As standards continue to develop, students require additional support to assist them in meeting the new demands placed upon them. As educators, it is imperative to explore new possibilities of challenging students so they may discover new learning experiences. This may be facilitated through the employment of continuous improvement cycles to build on best practices in lesson planning; learning experiences; and assessment of and for learning. Formative assessments are the vehicle for facilitating the paradigm shift. This study analyzes the use of formative assessments to improve student learning by examining grades seven and eight ELA classes in one school. This Participatory Action Research study focuses on instructional strategies to assist students who struggle to improve. The study further examines the use of formative assessment data in the planning process, as well as timely feedback.

AB  - As teachers in Georgia utilize formative assessments to ensure successful performance on the state mandated Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT), it is essential that the data they receive from these assessments are accurate. This study examined the correlation between the computer-assisted instructional program, Classworks, and student performance on the CRCT. The research questions explored specific aspects of the Classworks program, including student mean scores on the reading and math module quizzes, the student universal screener scores in reading and math, student time spent on the Classworks program each week, along with how teachers implemented the program in their classroom to determine if there is a correlation between any of the variables. Conceptually this study was framed within Twining's computer practice framework. Data from 200 3rd grade CRCT test scores, Classworks data regarding student performance on quizzes, universal screeners, and time on task, along with survey data from teachers regarding how the program was implemented in their classroom, were collected. A multiple regression stepwise analysis was utilized to determine the correlation between the independent variables related to components of Classworks and student CRCT scores, while also determining which independent variables had the best predictive value. Results of this study revealed student quiz scores demonstrate the strongest correlation, followed by the combined use of the quiz scores and the Universal Screeners. The social impact of this study could provide more knowledge to administrators and teachers on how to utilize CAI programs and for how long. This knowledge could assist teachers utilizing CAI technology to provide a more effective learning experience for their students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Formative assessments are usually informal and can range from oral question-and-answer sessions in class to performance events or quizzes. Stiggens and DuFour (2009) state that teachers and schools should use formative assessments to clarify what students are supposed to be learning, improve the instructional practices of individual teachers, and allow for reteaching of concepts to reach struggling students. This article examines the results of an action research project and describes how it improved teaching and learning in one school district. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This action research project sought to increase parental involvement to improve academic achievement in the subjects of reading and math for fourth- through sixth-grade students in two Midwestern metropolitan schools. An increased number of non-English speaking parents and working parents, a lack of parent training, and teacher resistance to parent involvement pointed to a need for improved parental involvement. Thirty-four student-parent pairs participated. Four types of interventions were attempted: using a variety of communication tools to enforce two-way communication; providing information about how parents can assist learning at home; regularly assigning interactive homework that requires interaction with parents; and distributing student work for parental comment and review on a regular basis. Both pre- and post-intervention surveys concerning communication frequency and parental academic involvement with their children were administered to students and parents; reading and math tests were used to measure academic improvement in the students. Post-intervention data indicated a modest increase in parental involvement; a slight academic improvement in reading; and no improvement in math performance.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of metacognitive strategies and content-specific feedback on student achievement in high school mathematics. Participants consisted of a convenience sample of students in honors geometry. An analysis of variance with repeated measures was employed to address the research questions. For both the posttest and retention test, students in the experimental group significantly outperformed the students in the comparison group. However, students scored lower in the retention test than the posttest. The findings of this study offer a modest contribution to the body of empirical research on the impact of metacognitive practice and content-specific feedback on academic achievement at the high school level.

AB  - Aim. The paper addresses the problem of formative assessment in the foreign language (FL) classroom. Its main objective is to present the outcomes of a study identifying tendencies related to the use of formative assessment during English lessons in Polish high schools, and students' opinions on the frequency, type and effects of assessment they had been provided with during secondary school education. Methods. The data come from a retrospective study applying a mixed-method approach. They were gathered with a questionnaire based on a Likert scale, complemented with a few open-ended questions. The responses were provided by 106 students who graduated various high schools in the years 2014-2017 in 36 towns/cities located in different regions of Poland. The frequencies of using formative assessment in the case of all the FL skills and subskills are presented in comparison to summative assessment. The qualitative data were coded with an aim of finding some common trends. Results. The study showed that in the case of the participants of this research, formative assessment in secondary education at EFL classes was evidently neglected. Many students (approximately 25%) acknowledged never having been provided with formative assessment with regards to pronunciation, receptive and productive skills. The open responses signal students' awareness of the importance of feedback and of several negative effects resulting from the lack of its regular provision. Conclusions. The data gathered in the study seem to call for the need to raise the understanding of the role and the practical abilities to use formative assessment in the EFL classroom both at pre-service and in-service teacher training courses.

AB  - Previous classroom studies have shown that the phenomenology of studied facts changes over time. However, pedagogical needs preclude both the study of errors and the separation of the effects that delay and repeated testing have on retention and retrieval experience. We addressed these issues together in an experiment where participants read stories containing correct and misleading information and provided Remember, Just Know, and Familiar judgements on immediate and delayed general knowledge tests. After 2 days, information learned from the stories shifted from Remembered to Just Known, but repeated testing attenuated this shift. Interestingly, similar patterns of retrieval and phenomenology were observed for correct and misleading information with one important difference—the shift over time to Just Knowing was significantly greater for correct than for misleading information. Together, these findings show the roles of information accuracy, delay, and testing in determining both retention and the subjective experience of retrieval.

AB  - This study is about the perennial minority achievement gap that exists and the current use of formative assessment as a method of reducing this achievement gap. The purpose of this quantitative MANOVA study was to find empirical data to support the use of formative assessment as a strategy for closing the minority achievement gap. One hundred randomly selected Wisconsin school districts’ annual accountability achievement scores and gap closing scores of identified groups that traditionally lag behind the White majority students were analyzed based on district-wide grading policy of either Formative Assessment or Non-formative Assessment. The results indicate no statistically significant findings to support the utility of formative assessment to reduce the minority achievement gap. Formative assessment has demonstrated utility in raising achievement, but formative assessment alone has yet to make any significant changes in the current status of the minority achievement gap. The persistence of the minority achievement gap and the overall lack of minority students to meet the learning objectives at comparable rates as White students continue to plague the American school system and need to be a priority for everyone. Although formative assessment has not been shown to have an impact on closing the minority achievement gap, further research on the tenets of formative assessment to close this gap warrant a closer look. Alternate abstract:Diese Studie befasst sich mit der bestehenden Minoritätsleistungslücke und der gegenwärtigen Verwendung von formativen Bewertungen als eine Methode zur Verringerung dieser Leistungslücke. Der Zweck dieser quantitativen MANOVA-Studie bestand darin, empirische Daten zu finden, um die formative Bewertung als Strategie zum Schließen der Minderheitsleistungslücke zu nutzen. Einhundert zufällig ausgewählte Schulbezirke der Wisconsin Schulbezirke für die jährliche Rechenschaftspflicht und Lückenschlusszahlen der identifizierten Gruppen, die traditionell hinter den weißen MehrheitsschülerInnen zurückbleiben, wurden auf der Grundlage der Distriktweiten Benotungspolitik der formativen Bewertung oder der nicht formativen Bewertung analysiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen keine statistisch signifikanten Ergebnisse, die den Nutzen der formativen Bewertung zur Verringerung der Minoritätsleistungslücke unterstützen. Die formative Bewertung hat sich als nützlich erwiesen, um die Leistung zu steigern, aber die formative Bewertung allein hat noch keine signifikanten Veränderungen im derzeitigen Status der Minderheitsleistungslücke bewirkt. Das Fortbestehen der Minoritätsleistungslücke und der allgemeine Mangel an Minderheitsschülerinnen und -schülern, um die Lernziele zu vergleichbaren Raten zu erreichen, während Weiße Schüler weiterhin das amerikanische Schulsystem plagen und eine Priorität für alle sein müssen. Obwohl die formative Bewertung keinen Einfluss auf die Schließung der Minoritätsleistungslücke gezeigt hat, sollten weitere Untersuchungen zu den Grundsätzen der formativen Bewertung, um diese Lücke zu schließen, näher betrachtet werden.

AB  - Previous research on the testing effect has primarily focussed on the benefits of testing at the cognitive performance level but rather disregarded the potential effects of testing at the metacognitive performance level. In the present study, we examined the potential of retrieval practise during learning to improve the accuracy of confidence judgments in future retrieval. In a learning-from-text experiment with 98 secondary school students, we implemented an initial test as retrieval practise and a final test one week later. Both tests assessed students' correctness of answering and confidence in their answers. The final test comprised items already tested in the initial test (testing condition) and items not tested in the initial test (control condition). In the final test, the proportion of correct answers and the proportion of confident answers were higher in the testing condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, the confidence judgments were more accurate and less biased in the testing condition compared to the control condition. The results are discussed in the context of the functional relations between retrieval practise and metacognitive monitoring. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The application of knowledge to new contexts (i.e., transfer) is a central aim of learning processes and has become a new focus of testing effect research. In a quasi-experimental design, we investigated the transfer of retrieval practice effects on English vocabulary learning on eighth-grade students (N = 182) by applying a typical testing effect study paradigm including study, initial test or restudy, and final test. The final test comprised four test formats, one identical to the initial test (non-transfer context), and three deviating from the initial test (transfer context). Comparing testing and restudy conditions yielded a significant multivariate effect of testing across all final test formats and significant univariate effects in three of the four test formats. Comparing transfer and non-transfer contexts revealed smaller retrieval practice effects when transfer was required. The results are discussed against the theoretical background of transfer-appropriate-processing, elaborative retrieval, and a distribution-based model of retrieval.

AB  - The pedagogy of teaching and learning has been changing since computers were first integrated into the classroom. As technology evolves, the evaluation of the instructional tool's effectiveness will continue to be an area of research need. The effectiveness of an instructional tool can be measured by student learning and achievement. Student learning and achievement was found to be most effective when the characteristics of active learning/engagement, frequent interaction, and feedback were present. The presence is provided by the instructor. Chickering and Gamson (1987) developed the Seven Principles for Good Practice (SPGP) in Undergraduate Education to improve teaching and learning. The population for this study will be students enrolled in asynchronous online secondary school courses. In an online environment, the classroom is provided through a Learning Management System (LMS). The instructor uses the tools provided in the LMS to interact with students. This study uses the SPGP that support the active learning/engagement, frequent interaction, and feedback characteristics for effective student learning. The LMS tools of updates, assignments, tests, and discussion boards support the SPGP principles 1, 2, 3, and 4. The student scores for pretest, posttest and semester final grade will be identified for each course. The pretest will be used as a control variable while posttest and semester final grade will be used as dependent variables in each hierarchical multiple regression. The independent variables for LMS tools will be determined by the instructors use frequency each semester. The courses are identified by curricular subject area and will be analyzed to determine if curricular subject area has any effect on the predictive power for both semester final grade and posttest scores. This study employed a data mining procedure to determine if LMS tools could predict semester final grades (achievement) and posttest scores (learning). The findings suggest that the LMS tools can predict posttest scores but not semester final grades. Additionally, the study determined whether curricular subject area had an effect on the predictive power of the LMS tools. The findings of this study suggest that curricular subject area can predict the variance in semester final grades and posttest scores. The findings also suggest that there was unequal variance across curricular subject areas for the dependent variables. By categorizing the courses by curricular subject area, the predictive power of the LMS tools was positively affected. The LMS tools had large effect sizes in science and social studies for posttest scores when categorized by curricular subject area. Additionally, the LMS tools updates, assignments, tests, and discussion boards varied in predictive strength and relationship to the dependent variables. The findings of this study indicated that the LMS assignment and discussion board tools were significant predictors with small positive effects for posttest scores. The findings also suggested that the LMS test tool was a significant predictor with a small negative relationship to posttest scores. The negative relationship found in this study contradicts the literature related to the frequency of tests in traditional classroom environments. The LMS test tool was primarily a learner-content interaction, whereas assignments primarily were a learner-instructor interaction and discussion boards were primarily a learner-learner interaction. The LMS update tool was a significant predictor for posttest scores but had a small positive relationship for semester-long courses and a negative relationship for year-long courses. The frequency of the LMS tools varied by curricular subject area. Specifically, the LMS assignment tool had the highest mean frequency across all subject areas. The LMS tools, when added to pretest scores, contribute an additional 3% (SY1516 YL), 4% (SY1415 SL), and 8% (SY1516 YL) prediction of the variance of posttest scores with a small effect. The LMS tools for SY1415 YL predicted 14% of the variance with a medium effect. Specifically, the findings supported the linear positive relationship between assignments and discussion boards for posttest scores. The findings did not support that the LMS tools were a significant predictor for semester final grades when categorized by school year. By categorizing the courses by curricular subject area, the LMS tools were significant predictors for semester final grades and posttest scores. The LMS tools categorized by curricular subject area had small effects for semester final grades. The largest overall effect of the LMS tools was on posttest scores categorized by curricular subject area. Career and technical education SL was a small effect with 6% variance prediction. For medium effects the variance prediction was 20% for English YL, 17% for fine arts YL, 15% for math SL, and 16% for world languages YL. Finally, for the large effects, LMS tools added 29% variance prediction for science YL and 39% variance prediction for social studies YL. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

AB  - World language educators are constantly tasked with evaluating appropriate and beneficial assessments for their students. This study investigated how first-year students in a Midwestern United States high school perceived three different alternative assessments in the world language classroom: Dynamic Assessment, Task-based Assessment, and Formative Assessment using self- and peer-evaluation. The researcher correlated the perceptions to the students' assessment scores. Additionally, the researcher compared final exam scores of the control group with those of the experimental group. The results indicated that the experimental group students favorably perceived the alternative assessments types, chose Formative Assessment as their most preferred and Task-based Assessment as the least desired, and scored equally as well as the control group students on the final exam.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to inform instruction by using data as a progress-monitoring tool to drive instruction and ultimately student achievement. During the course of this study, data was gathered from a pre-test in a mathematics measurement unit to determine differentiated instruction and grouping. Formative short frequent assessments were applied to monitor the learning progress of all students in a fourth grade inclusion classroom. Data was used to change instructional strategies, grouping, and teaching methods to ensure learning success on the unit post-test, and ultimately on end of the year testing. Results demonstrated that by incorporating methods of research-based instruction and implementing short frequent assessments, teachers could begin to bridge the gap in achievement for all learners. Monitoring student progress throughout the school year can inform teachers of the individual learning needs of their students. Teachers can use the data to measure the learning strengths and weaknesses, so that student performance can be analyzed and evaluated. The gap in achievement can be overcome using the implementation of targeted strategies and research-based interventions for all students.

AB  - Students in K-12 settings experience poor writing outcomes, with less than 30% of students writing at the proficient level. Coupled with the pressure to improve academic outcomes with limited resources, schools are in dire need of efficient, universally provided instructional activities that promote writing skills. Performance feedback on writing fluency was designed to be a brief, low-resource universally provided instructional activity to facilitate writing development and has demonstrated moderate to large effects on formative writing measures. The current study was conducted to directly evaluate the extent to which performance feedback on writing fluency is cost-effective. This study uses the ingredients method to estimate the costs of providing performance feedback on writing fluency and calculates incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on secondary data from a randomized controlled trial. Results suggest that performance feedback is more cost-effective than comprehensive systems reform initiatives and comparable to other universally provided interventions, and therefore should be considered a cost-effective approach to improve writing fluency for all students. Results provide school psychologists with concrete examples of how to support prevention and intervention activities aimed to improve student writing outcomes. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Researchers are increasingly aware that different types of discourse require varying psychological and neurological functioning of the individual. Some modes of writing are easier to master than others. This inquiry examines the effects of a curriculum based on both psychological research (primarily Endel Tulving's research into what he terms the "semantic" and "episodic" systems of memory) and neurological studies (the left-brain, right-brain controversy). The curriculum design uses Britton's poetic and expressive modes of writing to improve transactional (or expository) writing. Nine basic writers were involved in a ten-week series of six writing assignments which were initiated by a pre-writing visual stimulus and then developed into personal and imaginative modes of writing. The spiral curriculum they followed was governed by the short term storage space each assignment required of the basic writer. The writer moving within the spiral was to develop in what James Moffett has identified as two simultaneous progressions--toward differentiation and toward integration. A variety of sources was used to determine the effects of the writing curriculum on basic students' writing ability: questionnaires administered before and after, field observation of the students at work, and, most importantly, individual writing portfolios. Pre- and post-test data showed that all nine participants experienced significant improvement in their ability to write a transactional paper. Changes were noted in task performance. Two of seven dimensions showed no significant improvement: physical context cues and logical sequence cues. Significant improvement was found in five specific dimensions: extended discourse, classification cues, modification cues, organizational skills, and personal involvement. These improvements in writing abstract discourse indicate that these basic writers had gained enough ability, skill, and short term memory capacity to effectively organize and develop a piece of transactional writing.

AB  - Progress monitoring has been shown to be effective for gauging student growth in the area of mathematics. Likewise, self-graphing has been shown to improve student achievement in education. The present study investigates the effectiveness of progress monitoring as an intervention with a self-graphing component for second-grade students in the area of mathematics. This research examines the impact of progress monitoring on increased math skills, accuracy, and generalization to universal screening assessments. While results were variable, students' accuracy improved upon implementation of progress monitoring. All-together, results suggest that progress monitoring with self-graphing can be an effective intervention.

AB  - Research promotes the use of frequent quizzing, as well as the use of feedback to promote long-lasting learning. In this dissertation, I propose a method for promoting long-lasting learning using mastery quizzing. Participants read an expository text and then answered questions about that text. Some participants were required to take quizzes until they achieve a perfect score, which I refer to as mastery quizzing, whereas other participants were forced to take quizzes a certain number of times. I explored how mastery quizzing can contribute to students' classroom learning and whether this method is more effective than traditional quizzing. In Experiment 1 I first looked at whether the benefits of mastery quizzing may emerge due to the benefits associated with frequent testing and feedback. Next, In Experiment 2 I explored the role that feedback may play in the mastery model, exploring students' use of feedback and how that may impact final test scores. Experiment 3 explored whether attending to and processing feedback led to increased performance on a final test. My results supported an overall benefit of mastery quizzing relative to standard quizzing techniques, even when controlling for number of quiz attempts, the presence of feedback, and conditions meant to simulate a need to use the feedback to improve performance. These results imply that the mastery technique may be a more effective method to improve student learning than standard quizzing techniques.

AB  - The testing effect is the enhanced retention of learned information by individuals who have studied and completed a test over the material relative to individuals who have only studied the material. Although numerous laboratory studies and simulated classroom studies have provided evidence of the testing effect, data from a natural class setting with motivated students are scant. The present two-class quasi-experiment explored the external validity of the testing effect in the Introductory Psychology classroom. The control class studied assigned chapters from the textbook whereas the quiz class studied chapters and completed daily quizzes on those readings. Subsequently, both classes completed exams over this textbook information. The quiz class scored significantly higher than the control class on these test questions about the textbook information; these differences were significant both when the test questions were the same as the quiz questions and when they were new, related questions from the textbook. These data suggest the use of daily quizzes to embed the testing effect into the Introductory Psychology classroom can improve student learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine empirically the efficacy of using technology based formative evaluation procedures to provide instructional feedback and to determine its potential impact on students' learning, retention, forgetting, and rates of learning in urban classroom settings. The technology based formative evaluation assessment format used in this study is known in the literature as subjective probability assessment and is designed to measure student attainment on a two-dimensional scale. With this two-dimensional format the student is required to indicate both the choice of a correct response (recognition or competence) and the degree of sureness (confidence) that the student has in the choice. Hunt (1989) in his research found that the forgetting of previously learned information and the acquisition of new information can be greatly influenced by student confidence in information. Instructional feedback and training teachers in differential pedagogy depending upon student information quality are employed as part of the research design of this study. Misinformation, partial information and lack of information require the teacher to differentiate between the instructional strategies of remediation, review, and instruction. A pretest, posttest, post-posttest type of experimental design was used in this study to explore how this technology based formative evaluation procedure impacted on student learning, forgetting and possibly the rate of learning in mathematics. Ancillary data was also collected in an effort to examine if there was any correlation effect between student performance on the information referenced standard and the norm referenced mathematics test results that are administered by the school district. The results of the study revealed that learning is significantly enhanced with formative evaluation. Using an analysis of variance procedure and t-test methods the experimental group statistically outperformed the control group. Additionally, an analysis of norm referenced test data revealed that there was a strong correlation between the students' mathematics performance as measured by the formative evaluation procedure and the norm referenced testing that was administered by the school district. This indicates that the technology based, formative evaluation procedure can be used as an effective strategy for increasing student achievement and norm referenced test scores.

AB  - Researchers have expressed concern about the state of STEM education. To improve this situation, new pedagogies, such as blended learning, have been proposed and tested. The last decade has seen an increase in the use of blended learning to support learning; however, the effect of blended learning on learning remains unclear and often mixed. The two studies in this paper draw on data from pre-university science students in the following courses: (1) Electricity and Magnetism (E&M) and (2) Waves, Optics & Modern Physics (Waves). In study 1, the treatment group (blended learning coupled with two-stage quizzes & peer formative feedback) performed significantly higher than the control group (lecture format with online homework & instant feedback) in the standardized final exam. In contrast, in study 2, there was a non-significant main effect of groups, indicating that the treatment group (blended learning with online homework & instant feedback) and the control group (lecture format with online homework & instant feedback) performed similarly in the standardized final exam. The finding of study 1 suggests that the effect of an instructional pedagogical framework embedded in a blended learning context improves performance in STEM education. Whereas the finding of study 2 suggests that a blended learning context without incorporating any instructional framework or support for cognition other than the lecture is comparable to a traditional face-to-face course.

AB  - Any assessment data used that modifies teaching to enhance ongoing learning is a formative assessment (Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall, & William, 2004). Formative assessments are ungraded processes that provide students and teachers with relevant feedback focused on student processes and providing alternate learning strategies to assist with student misconceptions (Stewart, 2011). Formative assessment is more than a test or worksheet. There are other portions linked to a successful formative assessment initiative that are critical to the success of student learning. Grading, self and peer assessment, feedback, and classroom questioning techniques are vital to the success of formative assessment (Stewart, 2011). Many studies have affirmed that a strong formative assessment practice will produce significant student achievement gains. Most of all, formative assessments improve the learning of low achievers (Black & William, 1998). This study aimed to research the effects of a formative assessment initiative on student achievement and growth in eighth grade math. This study used a quasi-experimental design. This design included a pre-post test with both a experimental group and a control group. In School A, the teachers of the students were involved in formative assessment professional development training. In School B, the teachers of the students were not involved in formative assessment professional development training. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program. An independent t-test was performed to analyze the differences in student achievement and a chi-square test was performed to analyze the differences in student growth. Key words: formative assessment, grading, self and peer assessment, classroom questioning, and feedback.

AB  - This study was an investigation of the effectiveness of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) on the math achievement of first and second grade English Language Learners (ELL). The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 led to a new educational reform, which identifies and provides services to students in need of academic support based on English language proficiency. Students are from certain demographics: minorities, low-income families, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency. NCLB intended to lead as to improvement in the quality of the United States educational system. Four classes from the community of Kayenta, Arizona in the Navajo Nation were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups, one each per grade. All four classes used the state-approved, core math curriculum, but one class in each grade was provided with weekly CBMs for an entire school year that included sample questions developed from the Arizona Department of Education performance standards. The CBMs contained at least one question from each of the five math strands: number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data and probability. The NorthWest Evaluation Assessment (NWEA) served as the pretest and posttest for all four groups. The SAT 10 (RIT scores) math test, administered near the time of the pretest, served as the covariate in the analysis. Two analysis of covariance tests revealed no statistically significant treatment effects, subject gender effects, or interactions for either Grade 1 or Grade 2. Achievement levels were relatively constant across both genders and the two grade levels. Despite increasing emphasis on assessment and accountability, the achievement gaps between these subpopulations and the general population of students continues to widen. It appears that other variables are responsible for the different achievement levels found among students. Researchers have found that teachers with math certification, degrees related to math, and advanced course work in math leads to improved math performance over students of teachers who lack those qualifications. The design of the current study did not permit analyses of teacher or school effects.

AB  - Background and Aim: Spaced restudy has been typically tested with written learning materials, but restudy with visual representations in actual classrooms is under-researched. We compared the effects of two spaced restudy interventions: A Diagram-Based Restudy (DBR) warm-up condition and a business-as-usual Text-Based Restudy (TBR) warm-up condition. Sample: One hundred and twenty-eight consented high school students in 15 classes. Methods: Students completed daily warm-ups over a 4-week period. Students were randomly assigned to conditions within classrooms. Warm-ups were independently completed at the start of class meetings and consisted of questions about content covered 1-10 days prior to each warm-up. Students received feedback on their answers each week. A series of ANOVAs and ANCOVAs was conducted. Results and Conclusions: Results showed equal and significant growth from pre- to post-test for both conditions (d = 0.31-0.67) on three outcomes: Biology knowledge, biology diagram comprehension (near transfer), and geology diagram comprehension (far transfer). ANCOVA results suggested that the magnitude of this increase was linked to the number of questions attempted during the intervention. For the DBR condition only, there were interactions with content knowledge on diagram comprehension gain scores and interactions with spatial scores on biology knowledge gain scores. Students with lower biology knowledge and lower Paper Folding Test scores were disadvantaged in the DBR condition, whereas the TBR condition was equitable across all levels of knowledge and spatial ability.

AB  - Over the past twenty years, there has been significant research conducted on the effects of large-scale standardized tests on academic achievement. Policy makers around the world have developed policies and allocated substantial sums of money in order to increase the frequency of large-scale standardized tests, although existing research offers inconclusive findings as to whether the use of large-scale standardized tests leads to higher achievement. This study was intended to empirically examine the use of standardized testing and its relationship with student achievement. The study focused on two questions: first, why do some nations require their students to take large-scale standardized tests more frequently than others? And second, is there a correlation between the frequency of large-scale standardized tests frequency and academic achievement? This study examined data from the 2003 and 2009 administrations of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in order to address these questions. Results from this study indicated the frequency of large-scale standardized tests is most likely to be associated with testing consequence or stake (e.g., data are made public, etc.). Additionally, results suggest that the frequency of large-scale standardized tests is not significantly related to academic achievement.

AB  - Continuous assessment programs, which emphasize frequent evaluation over infrequent high-stakes testing, have been implemented in many developing countries as a way to improve learning outcomes. In India, continuous assessment is mandated in all public primary schools through the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) Program. We conduct a randomized evaluation of CCE in the state of Haryana. We find that CCE had no significant effects on test scores, and we can rule out effects above 0.1 standard deviations. We present evidence that the lack of impacts was due to the program's focus on evaluation without linking evaluations to changes in teaching practices.

AB  - Lab experiments and field studies showed that studying improves short-term memory, whereas active retrieval improves longterm memory – a phenomenon known as the quizzing (or testing) effect. In a quasi-experimental field study with four elementary school classes (18 < n < 22) and a pretest – posttest (5 min after the intervention) – posttest (6 weeks later) design, we tested the robustness of the quizzing effect under real conditions involving verbal teacher-student interactions in geometry lessons on symmetry in elementary schoolers. Results showed that re-studying compared to active retrieval (quizzing) enhanced learning more when measured directly after the lessons. This pattern revered when knowledge was measured six weeks later, demonstrating that the quizzing effect was robust. Moreover, long-term memory generally increased after six weeks. Limitations of the quasi-experimental approach are discussed.

AB  - The assessment of early literacy and numeracy skills can provide useful and important information in pursuance of the goal to increase student academic achievement. At present, there have been promising results using curriculum-based measurement (CBM) for evaluating early literacy and early numeracy. There has been little research investigating the use of both early literacy and numeracy CBM-type skills assessments in a comprehensive battery. This research extends previous research by investigating the internal validity of an assessment battery of literacy and numeracy skills assessed at the end of kindergarten and external validity in the form of predictive validity for second-grade outcomes in reading and mathematics. Results suggest that correlated factors representing early literacy and numeracy skills are being measured. Evidence of convergent and incremental predictive validity with respect to later reading and mathematics outcomes was strong, but discriminant validity was not substantiated.

AB  - This study examined the technical adequacy of vocabulary-matching curriculum-based measurement (CBM) to identify and monitor the progress of 148 middle school students in social studies. In addition, the effectiveness of a reading comprehension intervention, Collaborative Strategic Reading (Klingner, Vaughn, Dimino, Schumm, & Bryant, 2001), was examined across 8 weeks with 15 low-achieving middle school readers who were monitored with content-area reading passages. Results indicated vocabulary-matching CBMs are valid and reliable indicators of performance in social studies. Significant differences were found for the intervention group on performance on pre to post vocabulary-matching CBM scores. Difference-in-Differences regression models were used to examine differences between groups on pre-post measures. No significant differences were found between groups in weekly change in scores or trend in performance on vocabulary-matching CBM. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of reflective assessment in the form of situated metacognitive prompts on student achievement in the secondary sciences. A second goal was to determine whether specific gender differences existed in terms of student responsiveness to the metacognitive interventions. Participants in the study consisted of a convenience sample from a population of ninth-grade honors biology students in a large suburban school district located near Seattle, Washington. Beyond answering the specific research questions raised in this study, an additional aim was to broaden the growing body of research pertaining to the effect of metacognition on student achievement. A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design was employed in this study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed to address the specific research questions raised. Specifically, a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA was performed. For this purpose, a single within-subjects factor, termed Testing, was defined. Three levels were allocated to this factor, and quantitative data from the Pretest, Posttest, and Retention Test were assigned to the levels, respectively. Group and Gender were defined as between-subjects factors, and both were allocated two levels; the two Group levels were Reflective and Non-Reflective. The effects of Group and Gender on each of the three quantitative measures were examined singly and in interaction with each other. Tests of statistical significance were analyzed at the .05 level. There was a statistically significant effect for Group (Reflective, Non-Reflective) by Testing (Pretest, Posttest, Retention Test). A three-way repeated-measures ANOVA procedure revealed that students in the Reflective group outperformed students in the Non-Reflective group (F = 10.258, p = .002, Partial eta; 2 = .088). According to the effect size estimate, almost 9% of variance in the Testing variable was attributable to the Group variable. There was not a significant interaction effect for Gender. A three-way repeated-measures ANOVA procedure revealed that Testing X Group X Gender did not yield a statistically significant F ratio (F = 1.471, p = .228, Partial eta;2 = .014). Students in the Reflective group outperformed students in the Non-Reflective group, regardless of gender. The findings of this study offer modest evidence that reflective assessment in the form of situated metacognitive prompts may improve student academic outcomes at the secondary level. This study failed to provide a significant finding regarding gender-related variation in a metacognitive learning cycle. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper provides a description of practice outlining changes made to English assessment structures for the purpose of facilitating improved teaching and learning. These changes, which included marking, feedback, reporting, and the evaluation of the efficacy of teaching, were implemented across Years 7 to 10 English classes in an independent boys' school in the ACT. The current approach, which evolved incrementally over time, developed primarily through two stages. The first was a reimagining of rubric design, with criteria reflecting continua of transferable skills, based on the developmental nature of the National Curriculum. This initial change provided rich data but in itself did not lead to the desired impact on teaching and learning. The second stage involved a systematic approach to the formative assessment cycle. Within this cycle the collection of data generated from assessment marking has begun to fulfil its original intention of supporting teaching and learning through progress tracking, targeted feedback, differentiated grouping and improved evaluation of the impact of instruction on student learning.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 has had significant ramifications across public education. Due to reporting mandates, schools and districts are being held publicly accountable for the academic performance and progress of all students. Since implementation of the law, much attention has been focused on the 'achievement gap,' that is, any differences in performance between groups of students. Students associated with the achievement gap typically come from certain demographics: minorities, low-income families, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency (English Language Learners). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of using curriculum-based measures (CBMs) on math achievement, particularly ELL students. Eight elementary schools in northwestern New Mexico, divided into two groups (control and experimental) of four schools each, used the same state-approved, core math curriculum, were compared using a quasi-experimental research design. In addition to the regular core curricular materials, the experimental schools were provided with weekly CBMs, containing sample questions developed from the state’s performance standards. Each weekly CBM included at least one question from each of the five broad math strands: number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data and probability. Fourth (N = 283) and fifth grade (N = 294) students who had continuous enrollment for the duration of the experiment served as subjects. Successive regular administrations of the New Mexico Standards Based Assessment math subtest served as the pre- and posttest measures. Analysis of covariance tests, with the pretest as the covariate, revealed no significant treatment effects for either the fourth or fifth grade students through the use of CBMs as a supplement to the core math curriculum. The significant effects, supported by previous research, were the school and, especially, the teacher for both grades. In this study, the effects of the classroom teacher were of more importance to student achievement than either the school a child attended or what curriculum program or process a given school employed.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) effectively shifted the K-12 educational paradigm to a system that places a high premium on performance and accountability. The impact of the NCLB legislation and the adoption of the Nevada High School Proficiency Examination in Mathematics (NHSPEM) have created the need for instructional materials that directly target areas of deficiency. This article presents an analysis of two studies conducted on a web-based supplemental instructional tool designed to assist students in preparing for the NHSPEM. In the first of two studies, the performance of 64 students from 10 high schools who completed the tutorial was compared with 3,502 students who had no exposure to the program. A repeated measures ANOVA comparing pre and post NHSPEM scores was found to approach statistical significance (p = .051). In a follow up implementation study, students who had used the online tutorial and taken the NHSPEM for the first time significantly outperformed those who did not use the program (p = .024). Further, a higher percentage of students using the program passed the NHSPEM than those in the comparison group. Performance gaps for minority students were virtually eliminated for those completing the tutorial in the first study, although these results were not replicated in the follow-up implementation study. Recommendations for possible additions to the software and methods for enhancing the internal validity of future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reported is a formative evaluation of the Biological Science Curriculum Study "Biological Science: Patterns and Processes", designed for academically unsuccessful students. "Criterion referenced" tests were developed, with items selected to indicate the extent of students' learning rather than to discriminate between students. An alternate form, pretest-posttest research design was used. Randomly selected students within classes of teachers who had participated in feedback and training activities were given alternate test forms for each of five content areas. Scores on these tests served as the dependent variables with scores on Verbal Reasoning and Numerical Ability subtests of the Differential Aptitude Test, and Davis Reading Test scores serving as independent variables. Data were also collected on school and community characteristics. Analysis of covariance and multiple regression analysis showed significant differences between classes (tentatively attributed to teacher performance), and significant correlations between reading comprehension and achievement. Recommendations are made for revision of the materials and for similar evaluative studies. Appended are tables of results and statistical analyses, and copies of tests used. (EB)

AB  - Abstract: The paper reports results of three studies that used a formative assessment (FA) framework to compare schools that vary in their level of functioning as professional learning communities with respect to three processes: classroom assessment (study 1), development and implementation of school-based curriculum (study 2), and pedagogical conversations at teachers’ lounge professional meetings (study 3). When performed at their best, these three are inquiry processes that follow the phases of formative assessment cycles. Results supported the conclusion that school-based professional learning communities (SBPLC) make a difference in terms of FA practices enacted at both classroom and organizational levels. Moreover, classroom culture seems to mirror the organizational culture, where attributes considered as enhancing FA practice are clearly more noticeable in the high SBPLC group than in the low one.

AB  - It is claimed that curriculum-based external exit examination systems (CBEEES) based on world class content standards will improve teaching and learning of core subjects. Skeptics point out that Americans already take lots of tests, but advocates claim that CBEEES have uniquely powerful incentives because of characteristics that include their real consequences and external nature. They are assumed to transform the signaling of student achievement, changing the resources made available to schools and the priorities of school administration and teaching. The hypothesis that CBEEES improve achievement was studied by comparing nations, states, and provinces that do and do not have such systems. Four different data sets were examined: (1) science and mathematics achievement in the 40-nation Third International Mathematics and Science Study; (2) science and mathematics scores of 13-year-olds on the International Assessment of Educational Progress for 16 countries and 9 Canadian provinces; (3) Scholastic Assessment Tests; and (4) National Assessment of Educational Progress mathematics scores for New York (the only state with a CBEEE--the Regents Examinations), versus the rest of the U.S. The review of this evidence suggests that advocates of CBEEES are probably correct in their assertion that CBEEES significantly increase student achievement. Students from countries with such systems outperform students from other countries at a comparable level of economic development. When student demography is held constant, students from New York do better than students from other states without experiencing a decline in high school graduation rates.

AB  - Economic theory predicts that curriculum-based external exit examinations will increase student achievement. Tests of the theory support it. Analysis of data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study and the International Assessment of Educational Progress indicates that eighth grade students in nations with curriculum-based externally set secondary school exit examinations have considerably higher achievement than students in nations without an exit examination system. In addition, mean SAT scores for New York, the only state with such exams, are significantly higher than the scores of the other thirty-six states where the SAT is commonly taken when ethnicity, parent's education, and the proportion of high school graduates taking the SAT are held constant.

AB  - This article examines the effect of curriculum-based external exit examinations such as the French Baccalaureate, Canadian Diploma exams, and the Regents exams in New York State on student achievement. Students from countries with medium- and high-stakes exit exam systems outperform students from other countries at a comparable level of economic development. When student demography is held constant, New York State students do significantly better than students in other states on the Scholastic Assessment Test and on 8th-grade National Assessment of Educational Progress math assessments. Not only did 13-year-olds from Canadian provinces with such systems know more science and mathematics than students in other provinces, they watched less TV, did more homework, and talked with their parents more about schoolwork. Schools in provinces with external exams had better science labs, scheduled more time for teaching math and science, and hired more qualified teachers and had them specialize in teaching their subject.

AB  - The results of Fast ForWord® training on English decoding-related skills were examined. Finnish fifth-grade students were identified as having reading fluency problems and poor skills in English as a foreign language learned at school and were randomly assigned to either a training group (TRG) or a control group. The TRG ("n"?=?13) received 50?min of daily computer program-based training for a period of approximately 10 weeks. Students in the first control group ("n"?=?11) received the school's regular instructional programme. A second control group was composed of 14 average readers. The students' English skills were examined in pre-test, post-test and follow-up measurements. The TRG students saw an acceleration in decoding-related skills. The educational implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - The preceding articles in this issue describe a diverse range of projects which had in common the aim of implementing or improving the practice of formative assessment, and thereby to secure some of the benefits attributed to it. This article attempts to set up a framework within which each of the different studies may be located and inter-related. There are three main sections. The first deals with the roles of assessment, both formative and summative, within a comprehensive model of pedagogy. The second considers the specific ways in which the different practices of assessment feedback help to develop the capacity of each student to become a thoughtful and independent learner. The third reviews the ways in which new assessment practices present problems to teachers in challenging them to re-think their role and similarly to students, when for both groups, new practices affect their ways of coping in the classroom.

AB  - There is growing awareness of the benefits of curriculum-based social and emotional learning (SEL) programs in Early Childhood Education and Care settings for children's social, emotional, and cognitive development. While many SEL programs aim to strengthen teachers' capacity and capability to foster children's social and emotional skills, research effort has focused on understanding the impact on child outcomes, with less emphasis on improvement in teaching quality. This systematic literature review examined the effectiveness of universal curriculum-based SEL programs on teacher outcomes. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, capturing ten distinct SEL interventions. The findings suggest SEL programs may strengthen teaching quality, particularly the provision of responsive and nurturing teacher-child interactions and effective classroom management. Data were insufficient to ascertain whether participation improved teachers' knowledge, self-efficacy, or social-emotional wellbeing. The potential pathways between SEL intervention, teaching quality and children's developmental outcomes are discussed.

AB  - Based in the tenants of standards-based grading or specifications grading systems, earning digital badges allows students to engage with content until they demonstrate the required knowledge through assessments to earn the badge. Using digital badges to show completion of criteria has gathered attention, but a study involving their use in a secondary chemistry classroom for non-laboratory content has yet to be conducted. Reduction and oxidation (redox) chemistry has proven to be difficult for secondary students, and as such was chosen for this research study. One section of Honors Chemistry students was selected to use a digital badge system during a redox unit at the end of the academic year while two other sections of Honors Chemistry students were taught traditionally and without awarding digital badges. The same assessments, experiments, notes, and time on the unit were used with both groups of students. Formative assessment data was collected from the section which used digital badges, and summative assessment data was collected from both groups. Despite having performed equally in previous units of study, the section which used the digital badges scored significantly better on the summative assessment for the redox unit than the traditionally taught section. The students' engagement with the digital badges and achievement is discussed along with implications of digital badge use for teaching. Digital badges were shown to be a surrogate means for a teacher to use standards-based grading tenants in a traditional grading structure.

AB  - In 1991 the collaborative efforts of the Council of Chief State School Officers and the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory resulted in the current form of the State Student Assessment Program (SSAP) database. This report marks the third year of that partnership, which builds on earlier data collection efforts to present information about large-scale assessment programs at the state level. The survey collects information annually to describe state programs in traditional testing and nontraditional assessment and the uses made of these assessments. Chapter 2 describes state assessment programs. Chapter 3 explores newer forms of assessment, and Chapter 4 reviews additional assessment issues. Chapter 5 considers the history and trends in statewide assessment. Appendixes present definitions of terms, a summary table of state assessment programs, and the order form for the products of the SSAP. (Contains 16 charts, 2 tables, and 2 figures.) (SLD)

AB  - Abstract: Retrieval practice of previously studied information seems to be more effective in the long run than restudying the information – a phenomenon called the testing effect. In the present study, we investigated whether individual differences in the testing effect can be attributed to variation in gist trace processing. One-hundred-thirty-one participants (7–13years old children) studied twelve DRM word lists in a within-subject design with learning (restudying vs. taking an intervening free recall test) as a factor. Each of the participants took a final yes/no recognition test 1week after the study phase. A latent class analysis on the final-test data revealed three classes. One class of children did not show a testing effect. In the other two classes strong testing effects emerged, but the magnitude of the effect differed in these two classes. Furthermore, the three classes differed in false recognition of semantically related distractors, suggesting that the testing effect is related to differences in gist processing. We interpreted our findings in terms of fuzzy trace theory.

AB  - Background: Online formative tests (OFTs) are powerful tools to direct student learning behavior, especially when enriched with specific feedback. Aim: In the present study, we have investigated the effect of OFTs enriched with hyperlinks to microlectures on examination scores. Methods: OFTs, available one week preceding each midterm and the final exams, could be used voluntarily. The use of OFTs was related to scores on midterm and final exams using ANOVA, with prior academic achievement as a covariate. Results: On average, 74% of all students used the online formative tests (OFT+) while preparing for the summative midterm exam. OFT+ students obtained significantly higher grades compared to OFT-students, both without and with correction for previous academic achievement. Two out of three final exam scores did not significantly improve. Conclusion: Students using online formative tests linked to microlectures receive higher grades especially in highly aligned summative tests.

AB  - In this study, we compared two instruction methods on spelling performance: a rewriting instruction in which children repeatedly rewrote words and an ambiguous property instruction in which children deliberately practiced on a difficult word aspect. Moreover, we examined whether the testing effect applies to spelling performance. One hundred eighty-six Dutch elementary-school students (grades 3, 4, and 5) participated in this study. A mixed design was used in the present study, with age group and instruction as between-subject variables and relearning as a within-subject variable. We showed that after a 2-day retention interval, the rewriting condition outperformed the ambiguous property condition on spelling performance in all grades. The effect of relearning type was not significant nor was the instruction × relearning interaction. An error analysis showed that relative to the rewrite instruction, the ambiguous property instruction led to more errors on the non-practiced part of the words. By contrast, the rewrite instruction and ambiguous property instruction did not differ with respect to the errors on the practiced part of the words. The findings provide strong evidence for the superiority of a rewriting study instruction over an ambiguous property study instruction with respect to the performance on a delayed spelling test. Results from the conditional error analyses suggest that the beneficial influence of rewriting emerges because rewriting requires children to process the whole word rather than only a part of the word.

AB  - Although JEMP (Jaime Escalante Math Program) is currently in its 35th year, research has yet to be conducted on confirming the program's claims for increased math scores. This study examined the impact of JEMP's Pre-Algebra and Algebra intervention courses on student math achievement in District A (Los Angeles County). Archived math scores for middle school students from 2010-2013 in District A were examined. JEMP instructors used the MDTP (Mathematics Diagnostic Testing Project) assessment to guide instruction by providing formative feedback on students' progress. They also administered the CST (California Standardized Test) to all students at the end of the academic school year. This study sought to (a) determine if the MDTP assessments could predict student achievement on the Pre-Algebra and Algebra California Standards Test (CST) and (b) determine if JEMP improves students' CST math scores. A nonexperimental multiple regression design was used to investigate the relationship between the MDTP scores and the CST scores. A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group design was used for 3 other designs to determine whether student participation in JEMP increased student math achievement in Pre-Algebra and Algebra. The dependent variable was the post-CST, and the two independent variables were treatment and gender, with the covariate being the previous CST scores. The results revealed a positive relationship between the grade 7 Pre-Algebra CST and the Pre-Algebra MDTP, and between the Algebra CST and the Algebra MDTP. Students who participated in JEMP performed significantly better in future math courses than their counterparts who did not participate in JEMP. Although not statistically significant, the results showed that students who participated in JEMP for 2 consecutive summers had higher mean grade 8 Algebra CST scores than those students who received only 1 treatment. Results of this study will be disseminated to other local school districts to help them improve their student math achievement. Study results will also be used to revamp and restructure JEMP's curriculum and pedagogy to make them more relevant to the new Common Core math standards.

AB  - Empirical research utilizing the communal learning construct suggests that culturally-informed pedagogy enhances academic performance for African-American children. The present investigation examined the effect of culturally-informed learning contexts on recall performance in geography lessons. The sample consisted of 69 African-American Grade 4-5 public school students. Weeks 1 and 2 consisted of both learning and testing phases. Week 3 consisted only of a testing phase. Analyses of variance techniques revealed that, overall, subjects in the communal learning context performed significantly better on each of the two weekly quizzes and on the comprehensive examination than those in the individual learning context. Limitations of the findings and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the utility of oral reading rate as a metric in monitoring students' progress over time when instruction was occurring in a literature-based curriculum. Participants included 28 second-grade and 30 fifth-grade students who were currently receiving their primary reading instruction in a literature-based series. Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) probes were administered to these students twice a week over a 10-week period to monitor their progress in reading. Resulting data suggests that the CBM oral reading rate is an effective metric for use dth students who are being instructed in a literature-based reading series.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of data use on student achievement. Two research questions were considered: is the use of formative assessment tools (Yearly Progress Pro and Acuity) correlated to student achievement outcomes and are there factors (access to computers, a teacher's level of experience, or school level leadership) that explain greater use of formative assessment tools? To answer these questions, a series of hierarchical linear models were used that allowed for factors to be considered at the teacher and school level. While greater use of both formative assessment tools had a positive effect on student achievement for teachers, there was a statistically significant positive effect when Yearly Progress Pro was used more frequently. When considering factors that influence the use of data, teacher experience and access to computers were not found to be statistically significant influences. However, school-level leadership supporting collaboration had a statistically significant positive influence on the frequency of data use. Greater use of formative assessment tools is positively correlated to student achievement; however, further research is required to develop any causal relationship. Additionally, more specific research looking at the effectiveness of various forms of formative assessment in addition to how these assessments are actually utilized by teachers to inform their classroom practice would be beneficial. School-level leadership is also an important component to encourage greater use of formative assessment data, particularly when teacher collaboration around data use is supported by building principals.

AB  - In 2007, Georgia developed a comprehensive framework to define what students need to know. One component of this framework emphasizes the use of both formative and summative assessments as part of an integral and specific component of the teachers. performance evaluation. Georgia administers the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) to every elementary student in Grades 1 though 8. Before 2008, the state tested eighth-grade students on a quality core curriculum. In 2008, the state began testing students on a Georgia Performance Standard curriculum. A direct comparison of the curriculum change should have contained items to test both curriculums. However, this was not done. Therefore, the current study was designed to examine if differences in students achievement occurred because of the curriculum change. Archival CRCT and ITBS data from 21 middle schools were analyzed to determine if assessment changes affected student achievement. Results of two doubly multivariate, repeated measures ANCOVAs found no statistically significant differences between the two curriculums. However, the lack of significance could be attributed to the small sample size. The increase in scores at the end of the three-year period measuring the quality core curriculum and at the end of the three-year period measuring the Georgia Performance Standard curriculum provided partial support to the hypothesis of a difference in achievement between eighth-grade students who were taught and then tested under different curriculums. Recommendations for practice include the provision that educators be engaged in professional development in regards to the use of data. Most principals and district leaders do not have the skills to navigate high-stakes testing results. More importantly, though, are the university systems that should augment an instructional strategy class and add a data leadership class to the current list of courses needed to earn a leadership degree. Another recommendation is to those who develop criterion-referenced tests. Changing the score scales on the criterion-referenced competency tests when the curriculum changes make it very difficult to study data to determine progress over time. In the statistical world, this creates a confounding variable that may be hard to control. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - Previous research shows that being tested after studying a set of material will improve recall of that material on a later test. While this effect has been shown to be robust in adults using both simple material, such as word lists, and complex texts, little research has been done looking at this effect in children. In the current study, third-grade students were asked to read stories while being tested with multiple-choice questions requiring inferences and understanding of the main ideas, with questions requiring knowledge of facts, or with no questions. Afterwards, they were asked to give a summary of the text and answer short open ended questions. Results showed that children did better on the summary and open-ended questions after having answered questions than not. However, there was no difference between inference/main idea questions and fact questions. These results suggest that the testing effect is a robust effect that transcends type of question and age.

AB  - The effects of classroom assessment environment (CAE) variables on yearly achievement in mathematics and science in grades 7 through 12 were studied through the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY), using cohorts of approximately 3,000 students each in the 7th and 10th grades who were followed for 4 years. While the LSAY did not include all CAE variables of theoretical interest, it did include reasonable approximations of many. The direction of CAE effects was consistent for some variables and inconsistent for others. Percent of homework corrected and returned to students had a negative effect whenever it appeared. Hours of homework assigned and percent of students completing homework on time had positive effects when they appeared. Percent of class time used for testing and evaluation had significant effects only on math achievement (two negative and one positive). Frequency of oral reports had a significant negative effect for science, while frequency of written reports had mixed effects. Results do show some CAE effects, and CAE theory does explain some, but not all, of these effects. Results support the beginnings of a theory explaining the relationship between classroom assessment and student achievement. Six tables and two figures present study data. (Contains 14 references.)

AB  - Colleges and universities are experiencing increasing concerns about the academic readiness of entrants who have just completed high school. Such concerns are especially common at our community colleges where open-door admissions policies tend to attract a larger percentage of less prepared students. This study investigated a teaching strategy that might raise the level of student achievement in high school mathematics. The participants in this research consisted of high school juniors and seniors; two Advanced Math Analysis classes, a Pre-Calculus, and an Algebra II class. This research sought to determine if the external control stimuli of frequent unannounced quizzes would effect student achievement on unit tests. Quizzes were administered two to three times a week to two of the classes while the traditional lecture/test model was used with the other two classes. Each quiz administered lasted from ten to fifteen minutes and consisted of problems similar to those appearing on the previous nights' homework assignment. In addition to quizzes, a unit test was given every other week. Grading periods when frequent quizzing was employed as the teaching strategy were rotated with grading periods when quizzes were not given. At the end of four rotated grading periods the mean unit test scores achieved during the grading periods when the quizzes were administered were compared to the mean unit test scores achieved during the non-quizzing periods. For this research, the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test for paired data was selected to test the null hypothesis that no difference would be found in achievement levels during the quizzing vs. non-quizzing grading periods. A .05 level of significance was used for alpha. Students from the highly motivated Advanced Analysis classes achieved higher on their mean unit test scores when quizzes were administered, but students in the Pre-Calculus class and the Algebra 2 class showed no gain. The researcher concluded that frequent quizzing was effective in raising students' achievement levels in mathematics for those students who were already competitive and focused on high achievement. However, for students in classes that were less motivated and less focused on achievement, quizzing had no effect whatsoever on unit test performance.

AB  - National assessment data indicate that the large majority of students in America perform below expected proficiency levels in the area of writing. Given the importance of writing skills, this is a significant problem. Curriculum-based measurement, when used for progress monitoring and intervention planning, has been shown to lead to improved academic achievement. However, researchers have not yet been able to establish the validity of curriculum-based measures of writing (CBM-W). This study examined the structural validity of CBM-W using exploratory factor analysis. The participants for this study were 253 third, 154 seventh, and 154 tenth grade students. Each participant completed a 3-minute writing sample in response to a narrative prompt. The writing samples were scored for fifteen different CBM-W indices. Separate analyses were conducted for each grade level to examine differences in the CBM-W construct across grade levels. Due to extreme multicollinearity, principal components analysis rather than common factor analysis was used to examine the structure of writing as measured by CBM-W indices. The overall structure of CBM-W indices was found to remain stable across grade levels. In all cases a three-component solution was supported, with the components being labeled production, accuracy, and sentence complexity. Limitations of the study and implications for progress monitoring with CBM-W are discussed, including the recommendation for a combination of variables that may provide more reliable and valid measurement of the writing construct.

AB  - In educational settings, tests are typically used to assess learning. However, a great deal of research has also shown that tests enhance retention, often to a greater degree than does restudying the same material (i.e. the testing effect). Understanding how these encoding effects of retrieval differ from other forms of encoding is important when convincing educators and students of the power of repeated testing. One potential difference relates to attention: Divided attention (DA) is well known to disrupt memory encoding but typically has much less impact on memory retrieval. Less is known about the relative attentional demands of the encoding effects of retrieval. Because students are often challenged by distractions while learning, it is important to examine the testing effect, and its relation to attention, with materials and methods more typical of educational settings. In three experiments, participants studied educationally relevant materials (phase 1), restudied or retrieved those materials (phase 2), and then took a final cued-recall test (phase 3). Phase 2 occurred under full attention (FA) or DA. In all three experiments, a testing effect was found under both FA and DA and the level of disruption from DA was similar for both phase 2 learning conditions. This pattern emerged with foreign language word pairs (Experiments 1 and 2) and with educational texts (Experiment 3). Consequently, the encoding effects of retrieval and restudy appear to be similarly susceptible to distraction when learning complex educational information.

AB  - In educational settings, tests are typically used to assess learning. However, research has also shown that tests can enhance retention, often to a greater degree than restudying (i.e., the testing effect). Understanding how these encoding effects of retrieval differ from other forms of encoding is important for applications of the testing effect. One potential difference relates to attention: Divided attention (DA) is well known to disrupt memory encoding but typically has much less impact on memory retrieval. Less is known about the relative attentional demands of the encoding effects of retrieval. Because students are often challenged by distractions while learning, it is important to examine the testing effect, and its relation to attention, with materials and methods more typical of educational settings. Participants studied foreign language word pairs (Experiments 1 and 2) or educational texts (Experiment 3), restudied or retrieved those materials under full attention (FA) or DA, and then took a final test two days later. In each experiment, a testing effect was found under both FA and DA and the level of disruption from DA was similar for both learning conditions. Consequently, the testing effect persists even when retrieval occurs under distraction, and the encoding effects of retrieval and restudy appear to be similarly susceptible to distraction when learning complex educational information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement: This study assessed the effectiveness of two learning strategies, restudying (e.g., rereading) and retrieval practice (e.g., taking fill-in-the-blank practice tests), when learning educationally relevant information (e.g., foreign language word pairs and prose passages). Retrieval practice was significantly more effective than restudying when learning under both full and divided attention. These findings are important for both educators and students who are frequently challenged by distractions while teaching, learning, and studying.

AB  - Retrieval practice typically benefits later memory more than restudy (i.e., the testing effect). The benefits of retrieval-based learning generalize across a range of materials and contexts, leading many cognitive scientists to advocate for broad educational implementation. However, educators and practitioners call for more research on factors critical to education (e.g., individual differences between learners). One key understudied factor is the amount of relevant prior knowledge held by the learner, which can moderate the effectiveness of other learning strategies (i.e., expertise-reversal effects). The current study investigated the potential moderating influence of prior knowledge on the learning benefits of retrieval. To assess the causal effects of prior knowledge on later learning strategy effectiveness, we randomly assigned online participants to be trained in multiple topics within one of two academic domains over 3 days. Participants then engaged in a more typical testing effect paradigm—they studied new scientific text passages related to their trained or untrained domain and completed two rounds of focused restudy or retrieval with elaborative feedback (repeated for the other domain). Two days later, participants took a final test on the previously learned information from both domains. Despite being rated as more effortful than restudy, retrieval practice led to greater overall test performance (with larger relative benefits on retention than transfer questions). Critically, despite a substantial benefit from training-induced knowledge, testing effects were nearly identical for high and low prior knowledge information. This suggests that prior knowledge is not a critical boundary condition of retrieval-based learning. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: This study compared the effectiveness of two learning strategies, restudy (i.e., focused restudying of examples or key ideas) versus retrieval practice (i.e., short answer practice questions with detailed feedback), for learners with low versus high prior knowledge of the to-be-learned scientific text passages. Retrieval practice led to greater overall performance than focused restudy (i.e., about +10% or one letter grade higher) and these benefits were similar for learners with low and high prior knowledge. This indicates that retrieval practice is more effective than restudy when learning complex, educationally relevant information and that students with lower and higher levels of relevant prior knowledge will similarly benefit from retrieval-based learning.

AB  - The present study has two aims. Firstly, it aims to determine eighth grade students' conceptual understanding of floating and sinking through formative assessment probes. Secondly, it aims to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between students' performance in formative assessment probes and their achievement in the Standardized Science and Technology Exam (TEOG 1) exam. The sample of this research is 61 eighth grade students from a central middle school in Eskisehir. Data collection tools are four two-stage formative assessment probes and the scores of the student taken from the first TEOG 1 exam. The answers of the students to the two-stage probes were scored by use of a rubric. Findings indicated that most of the students either: (a) both chose incorrect answer and did not write correct scientific explanation (41%); (b) chose correct answer but did not write correct scientific explanation (33%); and (c) chose correct answer but wrote partially correct explanation (43%). This result indicates the poorness of students' explanation and interpretation skills in formative assessment probes. In addition, the findings of the dependent sample t-test results also indicate that there is a significant difference between the scores of the students taken from the standardized science test (TEOG 1) and the formative assessment probes on the concepts of floating and sinking. This finding shows that the students are more successful on standardized science test than the formative assessment probes in general. These research findings, suggest that students should be exposed to teaching practices based on "formative assessment" that promotes the development of students' skills of explaining, interpreting, and reasoning rather than multiple-choice tests in science lessons.

AB  - The use of computerized formative assessments in K–12 classrooms has yielded valuable data that can be utilized by learning analytics (LA) systems to produce actionable insights for teachers and other school-based professionals. For example, LA systems utilizing computerized formative assessments can be used for monitoring students' progress in reading and identifying struggling readers. Using such LA systems, teachers can also determine whether progress is adequate as the student works towards their instructional goal. However, due to the lack of guidelines on the timing, number, and frequency of computerized formative assessments, teachers often follow a one-size-fits-all approach by testing all students together on pre-determined dates. This approach leads to a rigid test scheduling that ignores the pace at which students improve their reading skills. In some cases, the consequence is testing that yields little to no useful data, while increasing the amount of instructional time that students miss. In this study, we propose an intelligent recommender system (IRS) based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm that can produce an optimal assessment schedule for each student based on their reading progress throughout the school year. We demonstrated the feasibility of the IRS using real data from a large sample of students in grade two (n = 668,324) and grade four (n = 727,147) who participated in a series of computerized reading assessments. Also, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the IRS in the presence of unusual growth trajectories in reading (e.g., negative growth, no growth, and plateau). Our results showed that the IRS could reduce the number of test administrations required at both grade levels by eliminating test administrations in which students' reading growth did not change substantially. In addition, the simulation results indicated that the IRS could yield robust results with meaningful recommendations under relatively extreme growth trajectories. Implications for the use of recommender systems in K–12 education and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - It is a common complaint among teachers that students forget what they have learned soon after taking a test. The phenomenon is seen in both secondary and undergraduate chemistry courses. This study examines the length of time after a test that students in three different chemistry courses (undergraduate nursing, nonscience majors, and high school honors) are able to successfully answer the same free response achievement questions that were on the test. Overall effects on achievement were found to be nonsignificant, as were interaction effects of time interval and logical reasoning level. However, a differential effect between courses on achievement was found, leading to the conclusion that students enrolled in courses in which the continued spiral use of chemistry concepts is not evident, frequent quizzing opportunities are not provided, and a final exam is not given experience a significant decrease in achievement during the first 48 h following a test. This decrease remains constant for at least 2 weeks. Students enrolled in courses in which the spiral use of chemistry concepts is more explicit and regular quizzing opportunities and comprehensive final exams are given did not show a significant decrease in achievement from the original testing to delayed quizzing occasions over a 17-day period.

AB  - Curriculum-based measurement and Gickling's model of curriculum-based assessment have been proposed as approaches that more closely link assessment and intervention. Research has clearly supported the independent use of these two models in improving student learning, but some have argued for a more comprehensive approach that combines the different curriculum-based metrics. This article demonstrates procedures for implementing the two models concurrently in a comprehensive assessment and intervention system by discussing three case studies. The first is an example of reading difficulties in a general education setting, the second is a student experiencing mathematical difficulties in a general education curriculum, and the third is a student participating in special education for reading difficulties. Suggestions and cautions for practice are included.

AB  - Technology-enhanced formative evaluation (TEFE) could enhance student achievement while diminishing the burden of formative evaluation for educators. The current study examined data from 360 randomly selected schools that either used a TEFE program for 1 year to 4 years 11 months, for 5 or more years, or not at all. Analyses of covariance found a significant and moderate to large (d = .51 and .78) effect on percentage of students who scored proficient on state accountability tests in math. Moreover, among schools that used TEFE, those with a non-White student population of at least 50% scored in the proficient range on state math tests at a rate equal to that of those with at least 50% White students. A significant and moderate to large (d = .71) effect was found, however, between these two groups of schools among schools that did not use a TEFE program. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Bloom has argued that most students, not just a few, should be able to do top quality school work if given appropriate instruction. Mastery learning, which includes frequent diagnostic testing followed by remedial instruction, has been proposed as an effective strategy for increasing pupil achievement. In this study, teachers used a mastery learning strategy with elementary school students in a geometry unit. An analysis of the data indicated that low mathematics aptitude fourth graders taught using a mastery strategy achieved at as high a level as high aptitude fifth graders taught in a more conventional manner.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of variations of spelling instruction in the elementary school classroom. A review of the behavior, educational, and psychological literature revealed a lack of cohesive information on spelling. A behavior incentive program was implemented in the form of daily testing with both groups. The control group continued with ten minutes of the traditional rote memory work while the treatment group, participated in a writing exercise using the words from the spelling list in creative stories. The treatment conditions lasted four weeks after which there were four and eight week followup measures to assess retention. Two dependent measures were used: (a) sentence form--the words were contained within simple sentences, and (b) list form--the words were written in the traditional list form. The results indicated no significant difference between the conditions but a significant effect over time. In both conditions there was a significant drop in retention from treatment to the first follow up but no significant difference between the follow up weeks. This indicated that after the initial decline of learning, retention seemed to be maintained. There was no difference between the two dependent measures. The results indicate several possibilities. First, the behavioral incentive program was too strong and overly influenced both groups. Second, the treatments were not distinctive enough. The writing group should not have been involved in any rote memory activities and the rote memory group should have written the words. Finally, classroom research is always full of potentially confounding factors. This study has several implications: (1) Behavioral incentive programs overshadow cognitive strategies for learning. (2) List testing of spelling words seems to be as accurate a measure of spelling as is writing words in context. (3) There is loss of retention after learning but it seems to stabilize after the initial decrease.

AB  - Despite high promise and calls for increased use, instructional technology has unrealized potential to support students in making sense of K-12 mathematics. This dissertation reports on studies of three instructional technologies, connected through themes of technology mediated formative assessment to support productive mathematical activity. Technology mediated formative assessment is presented as a reconceptualization of formative assessment were technology acts as a direct and indirect agent of formative assessment, gathering information on student learning and using that information to inform teacher decision making and/or the instruction of students. The first study reports on the design and effectiveness of an adaptive digital tutor for fractions instruction. The tutor acts as an agent of formative assessment, providing procedural and task feedback directly to students. This feedback comes from adaptive instruction based on student responses, procedural feedback based on patterns in student work, and dynamic feedback through digital manipulatives. A randomized crossover trial finds that a 2-week intervention with this software led to significant increases in student performance on fraction assessments. The second study reports on a mixed-methods study on how the classroom practices of two middle school teachers were impacted by incorporating interactive simulations and accompanying lesson plans into their teaching. Analyses of classroom video found significant increase in teacher use of student ideas, opportunities for students to explain mathematics, student critical questioning, and student mathematical discourse for both teachers when using the simulation lesson plans. Teacher interviews help explain how these shifts in practice occurred. The third study reports on parallel case studies of teachers using student response systems for formative assessment in high school algebra classrooms. Unlike other student response systems, Woot Math Formative Assessment allows students to submit work for their responses. The case studies reveal how this tool was used during individual and small-group formative assessment activities to support teachers in their use of student ideas, facilitation of productive discourse and use of feedback. The three studies provide complementary perspectives on how different instructional technologies can mediate the formative assessment process. Studies provide insight into how instructional technology can support both students and teachers in K-12 mathematics classrooms.

AB  - Student performance in the area of mathematics is a topic of national concern in the United States, with several reports documenting the need for effective instruction to boost student achievement. However, what type of math instruction will most effectively raise student achievement for students with disabilities (SWD) remains a matter of debate. Problem-based learning (PBL) is a promising methodology for engaging and motivating students’ learning while increasing their math skills. Enhanced Anchored Instruction (EAI) is a form of problem-based learning, rooted in a constructivist framework, which guides students through complex problems through video anchors and context rich environments that has been shown to significantly improve math performance of SWD. Assessing student performance during PBL units is often difficult. Formative assessments supplement curriculum by allowing teachers to gather information and assess student learning during the course of instruction. However, despite the rise in formative assessment use, the effects of formative assessment in PBL curricula are rarely addressed. This study examined the effect of embedding formative assessments in the EAI curriculum on academic outcomes in middle school math classrooms. Results showed that problem solving performance did not improve with the addition of formative assessment and gains on computation performance were mixed.

AB  - Formative Assessment is seen as highly beneficial for students’ learning, with regard to cognition, motivation as well as metacognition. However, a consistent understanding and use of the concept is still missing. This particularly holds for the German-speaking context. The present article thus aims at contributing to a consistent and comprehensive understanding of the concept of formative assessment within the German-speaking context. To this aim, we first illustrate different conceptual notions of formative assessment and following key characteristics, as shared learning goals, focus on learning progress, formative feedback, adaptive teaching and students’ active involvement. Finally, we present empirical evidence for the efficacy of formative assessment and suggest practical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Formatives Assessment wird, insbesondere im internationalen Kontext, als vielversprechender Ansatz diskutiert, um das Lernen zu fördern und dabei positive Effekte sowohl auf kognitive, motivationale als auch auf metakognitive Merkmale von Lernenden zu erreichen. Vor allem im deutschsprachigen Raum bedarf es jedoch noch eines einheitlichen Begriffsverständnisses, wozu der vorliegende Artikel einen Beitrag leisten möchte. Nach der Klärung von Begrifflichkeiten erfolgt dazu eine Darstellung der Kernmerkmale formativen Assessments (transparente Lernziele, prozessorientierte Diagnostik, formative Rückmeldung, adaptives Unterrichten, Partizipation der Lernenden), bevor auf empirische Befunde zur Wirksamkeit und Schlussfolgerungen für die pädagogische Praxis eingegangen wird.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of dynamic assessment (DA) and progress monitoring in the prediction of reading achievement for students in kindergarten and first grade. A total of 120 participants (25 kindergarten and 95 first grade) were administered traditional pre-reading and reading measures and DA in November and December. From December to April, weekly progress monitoring data was collected using curriculum-based measurement (CBM). Traditional reading-related measures and DA were administered again in April and May. Three variables from the fall assessment were used to predict four outcome variables from the spring assessment. Predictor variables included Fall DA, CBM intercept at week #1 (CBM intercept), and CBM slope over 5 weeks (CBM slope). Outcome variables included the Wide-Range Achievement Test Reading subtest (WRAT Reading), Woodcock Reading Mastery Test-Revised Word Attack subtest (Word Attack), oral reading fluency (fluency), and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test Spelling subtest (WIAT Spelling). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of Spring reading achievement. A commonality analysis was used to establish the unique contribution of each predictor. For the kindergarten sample, the CBM intercept explained the most significant unique variance on all four spring reading measures. Fall DA explained significant unique variance in WRAT Reading and Word Attack. CBM slope explained significant unique variance in fluency. For the first grade sample, Fall DA, CBM intercept, and CBM slope explained statistically significant unique variance on all four Spring reading measures. Fall DA explained the most unique variance on WRAT Reading and Word Attack. CBM intercept and CBM slope explained the most unique variance in fluency. Fall DA and CBM intercept explained the most unique variance in WIAT Spelling. Both DA and progress monitoring (as measured by CBM intercept and CBM slope) were useful in the prediction of Spring reading achievement. The relative utility of DA and progress monitoring was dependent on the specific reading skills predicted.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between formative assessment and reading achievement in Hong Kong, a Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) society. 4,837 Hong Kong students were surveyed in a nine-item questionnaire that was used as indicator variable of formative assessment strategies. The study used multi-group structural equation modelling (MG-SEM) to examine the effects of formative assessment strategies on reading achievement across low-, medium-, and high-achievers controlling for gender and social economic status (SES) effects. The result showed that after controlling for SES and gender effects, there was significant effect of formative assessment strategies with low- and medium-reading achievers but not with high-reading achievers. Implications are drawn to inform formative assessment research and practice relevant to students' reading achievement in CHC societies and other educational contexts.

AB  - This capstone project analyzes the impact of the Reading 3D program as a component of formative assessment. The research focuses on a pilot and a non-pilot group of elementary schools who have been utilizing the Reading 3D program as a component of formative assessment. The pilot group began the implementation of the program and was studied over a three-year timeframe to analyze the correlation of the Reading 3D assessment to student achievement. A sample of teachers, administrators, and instructional coaches from the pilot and non-pilot schools participated in a focus group to explain and reflect on their experiences with the Reading 3D program. Many institutions of higher learning utilize analyzing and reflection as a way to promote teaching and learning (Cochran-Smith, Varnatt, Friedman & Pine, 2009). The information provided by the participants provided relevant data related to student learning and formative assessment. The research yielded relevant themes throughout both focus groups and a central phenomenon of the written comprehension component of the Reading 3D assessment and the connection to literacy. The data provided evidence that there are correlations within the study; however, there are some variances to the strength of the correlations between the different components of the Reading 3D program. The results were not remarkable and did not show a strong correlation to the Reading 3D assessments and the end-of-grade assessments. These findings encourage future research as other criteria have been implemented and more schools have implemented the Reading 3D program to continue to monitor the performance of students and the Reading 3D program.

AB  - Formative assessment has been studied for the last 2 decades. Increased high-stakes accountability requirements have intensified the focus on preparing students to demonstrate increased achievement on end-of-course summative tests. Districts have turned to common formative assessments as a means to increase student achievement on end-of-course testing. Therefore, more study was needed to determine if common formative assessments lead to increased students’ achievement on summative writing assessments. This causal-comparative study examined two groups of eleventh-grade students to determine if any differences existed between student achievement scores on teacher-created formative assessments and common formative assessments created by teacher teams. Data were gathered from eight high schools that represented the entire population of Northeast Tennessee. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze data, and findings indicated that statistically significant differences existed when common formative assessments were administered to eleventh-grade students.

AB  - The Mathematics Diagnostic Testing Project (MDTP) offers course-specific assessments that provide teachers with timely feedback on their students' strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, often returning feedback to teachers on individual students and the entire class within a week of testing. In this way, teachers can quickly act on what they learn about their students' mathematics skills. This study examines the effect of MDTP testing on students' mathematics achievement, using detailed student-level data from the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD), the second largest district in California. The MDTP has in fact been used in two ways in the district. First, many math teachers have voluntarily used the tests for their classes. Second, beginning in 1999-2000, the district began mandating end-of-year testing of all students in certain grades. The goal of this mandatory testing was to help teachers place students in mathematics classes of appropriate difficulty in the following academic year. Schools also used MDTP test results to help identify students who should attend summer school. The authors find that mandatory MDTP testing boosts scores on the CST math test enough to move students up several percentile points. For instance, the median student (who ranked at the 50th percentile) in one year rises to somewhere between the 54.6th and the 57th percentile, on average, a year after the district-mandated testing. Compared to other types of interventions, these are strong and noteworthy gains. They also found that if a student is given an MDTP test two years in a row, the benefits that accrue the year following the first test strengthen in the second year. Several policy implications emanate from these findings. More districts could use the MDTP or a similar test not only to help diagnose an individual student's weaknesses in math, but also to direct assistance to all students lagging behind. San Diego's policy of steering struggling students to summer school is only one of many possible such interventions. Second, the idea of using diagnostic tests to steer students toward an appropriate math class for the following year appears to have produced tangible benefits. Districts might want to consider using the MDTP for this purpose. Third, at least in San Diego, the effects of diagnostic testing wear off if the testing is administered in only one year. Repeated diagnostic monitoring across grades could reap tangible benefits over the course of a students' career. (Contains 5 figures, 2 tables and 11 footnotes.)

AB  - This study was designed to increase student empowerment through the use of formative assessment. The targeted population consisted of first and fifth grade students in the same school. Evidence for the existence of the problem included teacher observation, students' lack of knowledge and skills to complete classroom assignments, and low test scores. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students were unclear about what they needed to know. Systems beliefs about testing focus on sorting students rather than motivating them. Students were not taking responsibility for their learning. Students did not have adequate, descriptive feedback on their work and were not encouraged to reflect on their learning. Parents were not informed about their child's learning. The researchers began each mathematics unit by introducing a lotus diagram, which is a visual representation of key concepts to be taught in that unit. As the lesson was being taught, the researchers related the lesson to the goals on the lotus diagram. The researchers used teacher-made assessments to determine if students made unit goals. The researchers used class graphs and individual student graphs to track progress. The students used portfolios to organize graphs, lotuses, and assessments. Researchers provided a daily 15 minute intervention time to reteach goals in small groups to students that did not meet the goals on assessments. Researchers also sent home family letters on each unit that described major goals and vocabulary for each unit. Researchers interviewed students individually, as part of their mathematics instruction. Data collections employed included teacher made assessments, student interviews, and anonymous classroom graphs. Post-intervention data indicated an increase in student involvement in their learning in the area of mathematics. Many students were more aware of grade level mathematics goals. They were able to talk about the mathematics goals and monitor their progress toward these goals. Students also displayed the ability to solicit help when needed in class. Appended are: (1) First grade student survey; (2) Fifth grade student survey; (3) First and fifth grade parent surveys; (4) Quality work activity; (5) Sample Lotus Diagram; and (6) Plan-Do-Study-Act.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the use of a method of distractor analysis for diagnosing item error response patterns and determine the effect of this intervention on student achievement levels on state administered spring mathematics assessments. Distractor Pattern Functioning was the treatment provided to teachers in this research study to evaluate examinee group performance on the incorrect answers by determining categorical patterns of group distractor selection. Methodology. This quantitative research reviewed four years of 3rd, 4th and 5th grade mathematics Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) data. Three school districts selected for this study participated in the method for analysis of error response patterns. The selected school districts were comprised of a total of 25 elementary campuses each serving students in grades three, four, and five. In this three-factor experiment with repeated measures, a three-way factorial ANOVA with two between factors district size and grade level and one within factor trials (3 X 3 X 4) was the research design used. Results. Significant difference was found between student performance and trials. Specifically, mean difference comparisons between trial 1 and trial 3, trial 1 and trial 4, trial 2 and trial 3, trial 2 and trial 4 indicated a significant difference. This is especially noteworthy in that the intervention or treatment was provided to elementary teachers between trial 2 and trial 3. Conclusions. The DPF method introduced in this research study is assessment result data analysis methodology that utilizes the power of distractor evaluation. Implementation of the DPF method for distractor analysis can provide educators with targeted information as to instructional strengths and instructional limitations and support educator efforts at identifying and implementing instructional resources, instructional strategies, and instructional interventions that have greater levels of effectiveness in the instructional process.

AB  - In today’s educational atmosphere, standardized testing is the metric by which a teacher’s ability to teach is measured. Teachers need an effective method for ensuring their lowest performing students improve on these standardized exams. Thirty-eight Maryknoll High Schoolchemistry students participated in a study to evaluate the effects of more frequent testing onstudent exam grades. The findings suggest a possible link between the frequency of testing and improved mean test scores on academic exams. Although the overall results of the study were inconclusive, the implication for using repetition and frequent testing as an effective method ofimproving student grades seems promising.

AB  - Laboratory studies show that retention of information can be powerfully enhanced through testing, but evidence for their utility to promote long-term retention of course information is limited. We assessed 8th grade students’ retention of U.S. history facts. Facts were reviewed after 1 week, 16 weeks or not reviewed at all. Some facts were reviewed by testing (Who assassinated president Abraham Lincoln?) followed by feedback (John Wilkes Booth), while others were re-studied. Nine months later, all students received a test covering all of the facts. Facts reviewed through testing were retained significantly better than facts reviewed through re-studying, and nearly twice as well as those given no review. The best retention occurred for facts that were reviewed by testing after a 16-week time interval. Although the gain in item was numerically small, due to floor effects, these results support the notion that testing can enhance long-term retention of course knowledge.

AB  - Early intervention to mitigate special education and reading risk is especially critical for low socioeconomic and minority learners. This study examined the lasting effects of an early reading intervention package of phonemic awareness on the reading skills of 38 second-grade students one and two years after intervention ended. The participants were kindergarten through second grade low socioeconomic, racially diverse learners from three urban elementary schools. Assessments consisted of standardized annual pre- and posttests and Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills regular measures. The findings showed beneficial effects of the early literacy interventions with strong responders attaining and maintaining benchmark status and with poorer responders needing more intensive instruction to show continuous growth. On the other hand, initially low-risk (non-treatment) urban learners failed to maintain their early advantage over their higher risk peers, suggesting the need for more extensive monitoring and interventions within urban settings. The implications of these findings as well as directions for future research are discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - In this article, we leverage data from over 1,000 students participating in two different online courses to investigate whether better learning outcomes are associated with student decisions to practice instead of (re-)reading. Consistent with laboratory and classroom findings, we find that students' decisions to practice are related to better learning outcomes. Moreover, we find that this benefit is particularly related to increasing the number of different practice activities completed and not repeating the same activity multiple times. Our findings are consistent with theories suggesting that practice testing improves learning by enhancing encoding promoted by practicing the same content with different problems and raise questions regarding the benefits of repeatedly practicing the same question. The work presented here also demonstrates one way we can leverage data from naturally occurring data sets and learning analytics approaches to inform theoretical developments and the understanding of cognitive phenomena. We argue that to fully understand the cognitive processes involved in learning we need to test our hypotheses in natural educational contexts, both using controlled experimentation and analyses of naturally occurring data.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to (a) determine if the use of formative assessment in the science classroom improved academic achievement in a group of ninth grade honors level students; and (b) determine the effect of formative assessment on the attitudes these students have toward science. Data was collected from two control groups (N=24 and N=26) and the experimental, comparison group (N=28). Students were administered two Likert-type surveys, an attitude survey and a causal attribution survey. Each survey was given at the start of the experiment and again at the end of the experiment. Summative test scores were also collected over the course of the investigation. The mean and standard deviation for summative test scores were compared. Analysis of the attitude surveys was done using an independent-sample t-test and a Bonferroni One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). While the analysis of summative test scores did not show an overall increase in scores, there was a narrowing of the gap between high and low achievers which may demonstrate a relationship between achievement and formative assessment. Most results of the attitude and causal attribution surveys were not statistically significant. The attitude survey showed a possible relationship between the use of formative assessment and improved attitudes toward the usefulness of science. Results of the causal attribution survey showed a possible relationship between the use of formative assessment and the attribution of success in science to ability and effort. These attributions are associated with facilitated learning experiences.

AB  - There is a significant concern about students' achievement in reading comprehension. The study examined the reliability, validity, and slope of curriculum based measures in a content specific area -- science. Participants included students in 6th grade science classes. The curriculum based measures (CBM) being used consisted of vocabulary-matching probes that were administered weekly, each probe having 20 vocabulary words and 22 definitions included. Terms and definitions were based on current material being learned by the students (Science Fusion) and Next Generation Science Standards terms. The criterion measures were the students' performance such as student grades and standardized test scores on the science portion of the Illinois Science Assessment (ISA), which were taken at the end of the previous school year. It was hypothesized that the CBM measures would demonstrate adequate reliability, validity, and detect student progress and performance. However, little research has been conducted over the development of vocabulary matching measures on science curriculum performance and progress.

AB  - Evaluated the effects of 2 review techniques on secondary students' recall of science lesson content: (a) an active review condition in which students used response cards to answer questions, and (b) a passive review condition in which students looked and listened while the teacher projected and read key lesson points. Ss were 23 9th graders, 8 of whom were formally identified as having learning disabilities, behavior disorders, or mental retardation, or who were enrolled in supplementary programs for students at risk for not completing high school. Scores on next-day and weekly tests were higher on lesson content reviewed with response cards. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Current educational policy highlights the important role that assessment can play in improving education. State standards and the assessments that are aligned with them establish targets for learning and promote school accountability for helping all students succeed; at the same time, feedback from assessment results is expected to provide districts, schools, and teachers with important information for guiding instructional planning and decision making. Yet even as No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and its requirements for adequate yearly progress put unprecedented emphasis on state tests, educators have discovered that annual state tests are too little and too late to guide teaching and learning. Recognizing the need for more frequent assessments to support student learning, many districts and schools have turned to benchmark testing--periodic assessments through which districts can monitor students' progress, and schools and teachers can refine curriculum and teaching--to help students succeed. We report in this document a collaborative effort of teachers, district administrators, professional developers, and assessment researchers to develop benchmark assessments for elementary school science. In the sections which follow we provide the rationale for our work and its research question, describe our collaborative assessment development process and its results, and present conclusions.

AB  - This research was carried out to determine the effectiveness and functionality of the word association test (WAT), which is a formative assessment tool that is frequently emphasized on today's modern education systems. The study group consisted of 60 students in a public school in Kocaeli in the school year 2018-2019. Participants were identified using convenience sampling technique. The data of the study were obtained by using pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design with no control group. The data were categorized by subjecting to content analysis. The findings were tabulated using the cut-off technique and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. When the results of the study were examined, it was concluded that conceptual change and development occurred in participants' minds and there was a significant difference in the results of the Wilcoxon test performed before and after the implementation. It was observed that the students wrote 1669 words before the implementation, and the number increased to 2193 after it. This shows that the students associate the key concept of "migration" with more words after the implementation and thus there is a wider connotation related to migration in their minds. In addition, the results of this research reveal that the WAT is suitable for formative assessment and can be used in educational studies.

AB  - As it is known formative assessment focuses on both learning process and learner's performance. In this study, digital formative assessment and traditional speaking tests were utilized comparatively to evaluate 52 upper-intermediate EFL learners' English language speaking skills. The study was designed as a mixed-method. The quantitative data were collected via achievement tests which had been administered both in traditional speaking tests and digital formative tests. The qualitative findings were collected with students' interviews which consisted of four open-ended questions. The results of the study showed that participants outperformed in digital formative tests in comparison to traditional speaking tests. Another significant finding of the study is that participants are satisfied with the digital formative assessments in terms of peer collaboration during tests, enriched test materials, and preparation time for the speaking test. Although they have positive views on digital formative assessment, participants are dissatisfied with it in terms of technical problems that they encountered during the administration of digital formative tests.

AB  - Classroom exams can assess students' knowledge of only a subset of the material taught in a course. What are the implications of this approach for long-term retention? Three experiments (N = 210) examined how taking an initial test affects later memory for prose materials not initially tested. Experiment 1 shows that testing enhanced recall 24 hr later for the initially nontested material. This facilitation was not seen for participants given additional study opportunities without initial testing. Experiment 2 extends this facilitative effect to a within-subjects design. Experiment 3 demonstrates that this facilitation can be modulated by conscious strategies. These results have implications for educational practice and the theoretical developments of the testing effect, associative memory, and retrieval inhibition.

AB  - SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) is one of the international e-learning specifications, which provides sharable content, compatible run-time environment and learning profile. SCORM supports accessibility, adaptability, affordability, durability, interoperability and reusability. People can share their own learning content with each other and learn things on the Internet. SCORM learning content can run on the SCORM learning management system. However SCORM do not have a complete evaluation mechanism. The SP chart represents students and problems. It is a tool to analyze the relationship between students and their answers to test problems. In this paper, we integrate the SP chart into SCORM as a formative assessment and add course as the third dimension to strengthen SCORM assessment. The developed tool can be used for SCORM assessment in three perspectives: student-problem, course-problem, and student-problem. So any test problem set and the student performance can be thoroughly examined. The tool was applied to a class and the empirical results are presented in this paper.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the testing effect in a regular college class. The research question was whether there were any differences in unit tests performance under different learning conditions. Thirty-three college students at a Midwest university participated in the present study. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with the independent variable of learning conditions (study-study, test-test and control). The dependent variables were three unit tests. Results showed that the mean unit test score in the test-test condition (66.29%) was significantly higher than that in the study-study condition (59.47%). However, the mean unit test score in the control condition (61.52%) did not differ from those in the test-test condition and study-study condition.

AB  - This study explored the phenomenon of testing effect during science concept assessments, including the mechanism behind it and its impact upon a learner’s conceptual understanding. The participants consisted of 208 high school students, in either the 11th or 12th grade. Three types of tests (traditional multiple-choice test, correct concept test, and incorrect concept test) related to the greenhouse effect and global warming were developed to explore the mechanisms
underlining the test effect. Interview data analyzed by means of the flow-map method were used to examine the two-week post-test consequences of taking one of these three tests. The results indicated: (1) Traditional tests can affect participants’ long-term memory, both positively and negatively; in addition, when students ponder repeatedly and think harder about highly distracting choices during a test, they may gradually develop new conceptions; (2) Students develop more correct conceptions when more true descriptions are provided on the tests; on the other hand, students develop more misconceptions while completing tests in which more false descriptions of choices are provided. Finally, the results of this study revealed a noteworthy phenomenon that tests, if employed appropriately, may be also an effective instrument for assisting students’ conceptual understanding.

AB  - A study examined the effects that a metacognitive strategy, self-questioning prediction, had on the improvement of reading comprehension. The sample included 17 eighth-grade students in a South Amboy, New Jersey middle school. The Gates MacGinitie Reading Comprehension Tests were administered as both pre- and posttests. There were three weekly sessions each consisting of two 38-minute periods of instruction. After the posttest was given, a t-test was used to determine whether or not a significant difference would be found between the means of the tests. The t analysis indicated that the self-questioning prediction strategy had made a positive but not a significant difference in improving comprehension. (One table of data is included; a list of the five steps of the self-questioning prediction strategy, and an appendix of data are attached.) (Contains 36 references.) (Author/RS)

AB  - In this article, we provide empirical evidence on the utility of a teacher-mediated diagnostic classroom assessment intervention for identifying and addressing learning gaps in learner domains. Early results, based on 11 treatment and 27 comparison classes with 381 students and 38 teachers overall, indicated positive changes in teachers' assessment practices and attitudes, with corresponding student achievement gains. Supplementary observations pointed to challenges in creating a learning-centered assessment culture in schools operating under a high stakes assessment climate. We situated the findings in existing research evidence on formative classroom assessment, test-driven school reforms, and the currently available body of knowledge on how individuals learn, and argue for more proximally conducted formative assessment by teachers to address learner needs and achievement gaps in subject area domains.

AB  - No Child Left Behind mandates utilizing summative assessment to measure schools' effectiveness. The problem is that summative assessment measures students' knowledge without depth of understanding. The goal of public education, however, is to prepare students to think critically at higher levels. The purpose of this study was to examine any difference between formative assessment incorporated in instruction as opposed to the usual, more summative methods in terms of attitudes and academic achievement of middle-school science students. Maslow's theory emphasizes that individuals must have basic needs met before they can advance to higher levels. Formative assessment enables students to master one level at a time. The research questions focused on whether statistically significant differences existed between classrooms using these two types of assessments on academic tests and an attitude survey. Using a quantitative quasi-experimental control-group design, data were obtained from a sample of 430 middle-school science students in 6 classes. One control and 2 experimental classes were assigned to each teacher. Results of the independent t tests revealed academic achievement was significantly greater for groups that utilized formative assessment. No significant difference in attitudes was noted. Recommendations include incorporating formative assessment results with the summative results. Findings from this study could contribute to positive social change by prompting educational stakeholders to examine local and state policies on curriculum as well as funding based on summative scores alone. Use of formative assessment can lead to improved academic success.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of criteria-referenced formative assessment (CRFA) on elementary students' achievement in theater arts and the transfer effect of the treatment on English language arts (ELA) achievement. The role of gender and task type in moderating the treatment-achievement relationship was also explored. The analytical sample included 520 fifth-grade students from thirteen classes who participated in the Arts Achieve project. Selection bias in treatment assignment was adjusted with propensity score analysis (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) for the purposes of obtaining asymptotically unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It was found that classroom-based CRFA had varied effects on different theater arts learning outcomes with respect to both the magnitude and the direction of the effect. Specifically, the CRFA had a notable positive effect (d=.25) on students' achievement on performance tasks, but no significant effect on students' performance on the analytical constructed response task or the theater vocabulary multiple-choice items. There was no evidence of any effect of gender, nor was there a transfer effect of the treatment on students' achievement on the New York State standardized ELA test. This study contributes to the formative assessment literature by pioneering the investigation of the effect of CRFA within the educational context of theater arts learning, with a consideration of the role of factors that might influence the efficacy of CRFA such as gender and task type. Despite the relatively rigorous design and analysis, the findings of the study should be interpreted and generalized with caution given its limitations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of criteria-referenced formative assessment on achievement in the arts. Seventy-five schools in New York City were assigned to either the treatment or control condition. The treatment involved 3195 elementary, middle, or high school students instructed by 43 music, visual arts, theater, or dance teachers. The teachers were involved in a professional development program focused on formative assessment practices, particularly criteria-referenced peer and self-assessment. The control group consisted of 2445 students in classes instructed by 32 teachers who did not receive the professional development. Discipline-specific, performance-based pre- and post-measures were used to evaluate student learning. Fidelity of implementation was examined before the analysis of the treatment effect. Propensity score matching analysis was used to examine group differences in performance on the post-assessment. Results based on a sample of 611 matched pairs of students showed that, overall, criteria-referenced formative assessment had a statistically significant, positive effect (d = 0.26) on students' arts achievement.

AB  - Formative assessment (FA) has enjoyed much popularity in educational assessment in recent years, especially for the teaching of writing. However, the application of FA in academic English writing (AEW) has rarely been studied. Employing both quantitative and qualitative methods, this study is designed to explore the effectiveness of FA in the process approach of AEW for EFL learners in China. Results from a T-test show that there is a significant difference in students' performance between the experimental and the control group. Meanwhile, the results of repeated measures ANOVA demonstrate significant difference among the three drafts produced by the participants in the experimental group. Qualitative studies also show that feedback provided by both peers and the teacher is treated seriously by most learners, which contributes to the gradual improvement of their writing. The results of the study suggest that FA may be more effective than summative assessment (SA) for the improvement of learners' AEW ability.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of criteria-referenced formative assessment (CRFA) on students' achievement in theater arts. The role of type of task in differentiating the treatmentachievement relationship was explored. The analytical sample included 520 fifth-grade students from 13 schools in New York City. Schools were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. Selection bias in treatment assignment at student level was adjusted with propensity score analysis. CRFA had a positive effect on students' achievement on performance tasks (d = 0.25), but no significant effect on students' performance on the analytical constructed response tasks or the theater vocabulary multiplechoice items.

AB  - The collaborative reading annotation system (CRAS) has been proved its success in promoting reading performance in comparison with traditional paper-based reading. However, there is still lack of an effective formative assessment and feedback mechanisms in the CRAS, which can assist learners to promote their self-regulated learning and reflection. Therefore, this study uses C4.5 decision tree to develop a CRAS with formative assessment and feedback mechanisms (CRAS-FAFM) based on four considered social network indicators, which could forecast the learners with low reading comprehension and suggest them to interact with the learners who are predicted with high reading comprehension performance and infrequently interact in the digital reading activity in order to enhance their reading comprehension through interactive discussion. Accordingly, this study intends to discuss the effects of learners who use the CRAS-FAFM and CRAS without formative assessment and feedback mechanisms (CRAS-NFAFM) on reading comprehension performance and interactive discussion. A total of 55 students from two classes of a Taiwan’s primary school participated in the experiment. One class of students was randomly assigned as the experimental group using the CRAS-FAFM to support digital reading while the remaining class was randomly assigned as the control group using the CRAS-NFAFM. Analytical results show that the average prediction accuracy rate of the developed CRAS-FAFM in identifying the learners with low reading comprehension performance is as high as 68.33%. Moreover, compared to CRAS-NFAFM, the CRAS-FAFM provides remarkable benefits in promoting the reading comprehension performance and interactive discussion on the discussion level of comparison, discussion, and analysis, particularly for the learners with low prior knowledge.

AB  - Background: The worked example effect in cognitive load theory suggests that providing worked examples first followed by solving similar problems would facilitate students' learning. Using problem solving-worked example sequence is another way of implementing example-based instruction. Although research has demonstrated the superiority of worked example-problem solving sequence on learning materials that presumably are high in element interactivity for novices, none of the previous studies have compared the two sequences with levels of element interactivity experimentally manipulated in a strictly controlled manner. Aim: The reported study aimed to investigate the effects of levels of element interactivity of the learning tasks and levels of learner prior knowledge on the effectiveness of two alternative example-based sequences, worked example--problem solving versus problem solving-worked example. Sample: Fifty-two Year five students, around 10 to 11 years old, from a primary school in Indonesia participated in Experiment 1, and 96 Year eight students, around 13 to 14 years old, from a secondary school in Indonesia participated in Experiment 2. Methods: 2 (sequences: worked example-problem solving vs. problem solving-worked example) × 2 (levels of element interactivity: low vs. high) experimental design, with the second factor repeatedly measured, was used in the two experiments conducted with learners at different levels of prior knowledge. Result: The results showed the advantage of using worked example-problem solving sequence for learning materials high in element interactivity, especially for novice learners, whereas there were no differences between the worked example-problem solving and problem solving-worked example sequences for learning materials low in element interactivity for more knowledgeable learners. Conclusion: This study not only replicated the results of previous studies, but also extended their findings by experimentally manipulating levels of element interactivity of learning materials.

AB  - The popularity of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) has grown and, in many countries, are nearly ubiquitous. Nevertheless, a lack of training, among other factors, has led to teachers misusing, or even abandoning this technology. While IWBs should improve learning outcomes, few studies have evaluated the impact of long-term IWB-based instruction. The purpose of this study is to track changes in the mathematical performance through formative assessment (FA) for primary school students participating in an IWB Formative Assessment (FA) system, characterized by elements including feedback, social learning through discussions, agentive learning through personalized options, and game-based learning featuring among-group competition and within-group collaboration. A convenience sample of 178 s-grade students from the same grade (four classes) participated in the study, which lasted one school year. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized to analyze data from the IWB system, revealing the following: (1) a significant correlation between students' involvement in formative IWB activities and mathematics achievement (t = 6.52; p = 0.00); (2) no effect of gender on initial mathematics performance; (3) a significant role of student motivational goals on initial mathematics performance, with higher mastery-avoidance associated with better initial assessments (t = 2.02, p = 0.04) and higher performance-avoidance associated with lower initial assessments (t = −2.60, p = 0.03); (4) interaction between gender and linear change, with girls outperforming boys (t = −2.57, p = 0.01) in FA performance over time (although boys made advances on summative assessments); and (5) a negative interaction of mastery-avoidance with linear change, where higher levels of mastery-avoidance were associated with a greater decline in FA performance over time (t = −2.57, p = 0.01). In short, the research findings suggest that if teachers use IWB-based FA over a relatively long time, they must pay special attention to boys and those who hold high mastery-avoidance goals. • Formative assessment using IWBs utilized networking, interaction, and community. • Formative assessment using IWB predicted subsequent math achievement test results. • Mastery and performance avoidance orientation impact formative and summative results. • Observed gender differences in achievement and learning trajectories favored girls. • Long-term IWB-based assessments must consider gender and goal orientation factors.

AB  - Flipped learning is allowed students to increase opportunities for active learning in the learning process. Although previous studies have shown that there was a positive impact of flipped learning on class, few studies have combined flipped learning with formative assessment to explore students' learning performance in terms of programming. Hence, this study adopted a quasi-experimental design to recruit 121 students for 15 weeks of experimental activities. The experimental group used a combination of flipped learning and formative assessment to explore whether their learning performance was higher than that of the control group using flipped learning. In addition, this study established an online formative assessment platform to provide the experimental group with online formative assessment tests. According to the results, the learning performance of the experimental group in the second test and the third test was significantly higher than that of the control group. On the other hand, the experimental group could still achieve better learning performance in the more difficult units (units 7 to 12). In addition, the researchers showed that when the duration of the experiment was longer and the experimental group of students continued to use the online formative assessment platform to administer the test, their learning performance in terms of programming was also significantly enhanced. Therefore, this study demonstrated the effectiveness and contribution of combining flipped learning with formative assessment in terms of programming.

AB  - Federal and state initiatives (No Child Left Behind, 2001) require schools and districts to set high standards for student growth and achievement. Currently, student growth and progress are measured in Louisiana via statewide achievement tests. In 4th and 8th grades these assessments are considered to be 'high-stakes', as promotion and retention decisions are made based on how well students perform on these assessments. Making day-to-day decisions based on one assessment per year is not best practice (Jenkins, Deno,&Markin, 1979); therefore, screening instruments known as curriculum based measures (CBMs) were devised and tailored for school-based implementation. CBMs of academic skills have been shown to predict scores on statewide achievement tests (e.g. Good, Simmons, and Kameenui, 2001; Shaw&Shaw, 2002; Keller-Margulis, Shapiro, and Hintze, 2008). However, less research has been conducted using behavior screening instruments, despite the fact that the relationship among behavior and academic achievement has been extensively documented. The current study adds to the literature base by assessing the predictive validity of commercially available behavior screening instruments for statewide achievement test scores in a school district in Louisiana. Results show that two of four behavior screenings within the program are independent predictors of statewide testing scores in addition to academic screenings and prior achievement in their respective content areas. Implications of these findings are that it may prove beneficial for schools to proactively screen for and intervene with behavior problems as early and frequently as possible.

AB  - This article describes a study of the effects of partial replacement of lectures with a system of prescribed reading, supported by weekly objective testing in a second year animal physiology module. Formative tests with feedback within 24 hours were followed a week later with summative tests on the same material, utilising a proportion of the same questions. Over a three year period, students' reported study hours during the module increased significantly over their normal study time. Summative test scores were always significantly higher than the preceding formative test scores. More study hours were devoted to the summatively assessed material. The topics taught in this way (nerve, muscle and endocrine physiology) were previously the subject of the poorest examination results, and were chosen least as examination essay topics. During the three years of the study, examination results improved for nerve physiology (marginal statistical significance) but the proportion of students choosing the different topics for their examination answers was unchanged. Students approved of the learning regime, but only when supported by some lectures. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Formative assessment can raise standards of achievement. In physical education, when formative assessment was incorporated into instruction, students performed better in terms of skills and were more on-task. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of formative assessment on success and response rate of a sixth grade badminton unit. Specifically, this study aims to study how formative assessments impact response and success rates of the more skilled, average skilled and lower skilled students in a badminton unit in physical education. Sixteen students from two sixth grade classes took part in this study. One class served as the treatment group, where the teacher incorporated formative assessments in her teaching, while the other class served as the control group. The current study found that students in the treatment group were more on-task than the students in the control group based on the response rate. Students in the treatment group had higher response rate, and this difference was statistically significant. Although the treatment group showed a 10% higher mean success rate, the results were statistically insignificant. This study confirmed students were more on-task and had a higher response rate when formative assessments were incorporated into the lesson.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of the BYOD (bring your own device) approach on student language learning. In the research scenario, junior high school students brought their Android-based smart phones to class in order to engage in language evaluation activities, where an application (app) called Socrative was used as a learning assessment tool. A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control group design was used to answer the research question. 46 eighth-grade students from two classes at a public junior high school in Taiwan participated in the four-week educational experiment. Student participants received 6 quizzes as a formative evaluation during the experiment. A learning achievement test (summative evaluation) was developed to measure the students' understanding of English vocabulary and grammar. One month after the completion of the summative evaluation, the same achievement test (delayed summative evaluation) with different item numbers was administered to assess the long-term transfer of learning in the students. A self-report questionnaire and an informal interview were used to ascertain the students' learning experiences. The formative evaluation results showed that students in the traditional instruction class outperformed those in the BYOD instruction class because several BYOD students were not familiar with the BYOD approach. Although the BYOD and the traditional instruction approaches yielded similar summative evaluation and delayed summative evaluation results, the BYOD approach demonstrated a valuable benefit on the students' long-term transfer of learning. Students in the BYOD instruction class exhibited a steady growth on learning outcomes and subsequently scored higher on the learning retention segment of the study. In addition, the BYOD teaching practice advanced the students’ second language learning experiences, particularly regarding learning motivation and interest. The results of the study suggested that schools and teachers should explore creative ways to integrate traditional and BYOD approaches. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study is about the effectiveness of concept maps as a formative assessment. It aimed to investigate the effectiveness of concept maps in formative assessment for the teaching and learning of biological concepts at the secondary level. One group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used for this study. The experiment was completed in six weeks. A sample of 46 students was selected from Karimabad District Hunza. Data were collected by conducting a Bioenergetics Diagnostic Test at each interval with and without intervention. It was found that concept maps are useful for the development of a clear understanding of concepts in Biology. Concept maps refrain from rote learning thus promoting critical thinking and reasoning ability and act as an effective classroom instructional and a formative assessment tool. It was concluded that the concept maps can be used as an effective formative assessment tool in Biology at the secondary level.

AB  - Curriculum Based Measurement (CBM) has become an increasingly popular instrument/methodology for reading assessment. In part, its popularity derives from promises of formative assessment (i.e., progress monitoring). However, a review of the literature suggests CBM formative assessment applications may lack the requisite reliability evidence. Furthermore, available research provides support and direction to improve the accuracy and stability of formative assessment outcomes. The primary purpose of this research was to evaluate and compare the effects of a controlled set of reading passages on student performance. Researchers developed a controlled set of Curriculum Like Measurement (CLM) reading passages from a sample of unfamiliar grade-specific reading curriculums. Each grade-specific passage-set was controlled for passage-difficulty using the Spache and Dale-Chall readability formulas. Analysis compared CBM and CLM formative assessment outcomes. A second purpose of this study was to compare short-term (10-week) assessment outcomes with the negatively accelerating developmental trends that have been documented with long-term assessment (i.e., 36-week). Analysis tested for differences in stability of growth-estimates [SE(b)], accuracy of predictions (SEE), and observed growth-rates/slope (b). 99 students in grades second to fifth participated over 10 weeks. Results suggest CLM progress monitoring outcomes are more stable and accurate than CBM. Results did not demonstrate the negatively accelerating curvilinear relationship between grades. Results and implications are discussed.

AB  - The current study extended previous research on curriculum-based measurement in mathematics (M-CBM) assessments. The purpose was to examine the generalizability and dependability of multiple-skill M-CBM computation assessments across various assessment durations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 minutes). Results of generalizability and dependability studies (N = 104 students) suggest that relative interindividual decisions can rely on the results from 1-minute administrations for low-stakes decisions and the results of 4-minute administrations for high-stakes decisions. Moreover, absolute intraindividual decisions can rely on the results from 4-minute administrations for low-stakes decisions and 13-minute administrations for high-stakes decisions. The implications and limitations of these results are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Psychol Schs 42: 615–622, 2005.

AB  - Abstract. Curriculum-based measurement of oral reading fluency (CBM-R) is an established procedure used to index the level and trend of student growth. A substantial literature base exists regarding best practices in the administration and interpretation of CBM-R; however, research has yet to adequately address the potential influence of measurement error. This study extends results of Hintze and Christ (2004) by incorporating research-based estimates of the standard error of the estimate (SEE) to generate likely magnitudes for the standard error of the slope (SEb) across a variety of progress monitoring durations and measurement conditions. Fourteen progress monitoring durations (2-15 weeks) and nine levels of SEE (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) were used to derive SEb. The outcomes are discussed in relation to assessment practices, such as selecting optimal progress monitoring durations to reduce measurement error. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - Curriculum-based measurement of oral reading (CBM-R) is used to index the level and rate of student growth across the academic year. The method is frequently used to set student goals and monitor student progress. This study examined the diagnostic accuracy and quality of growth estimates derived from pre-post measurement using CBM-R data. A linear mixed effects regression model was used to simulate progress-monitoring data for multiple levels of progress-monitoring duration (6, 8, 10,...,20 weeks) and data set quality, which was operationalized as residual/error in the model (sigma[subscript epsilon]= 5, 10, 15, and 20). Results indicate that the duration of instruction, quality of data, and method used to estimate growth influenced the reliability and precision of estimated growth rates, in addition to the diagnostic accuracy. Pre-post methods to derive CBM-R growth estimates are likely to require 14 or more weeks of instruction between pre-post occasions. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Under No Child Left Behind, urban school districts have increasingly turned to interim assessments, administered at regular intervals, to help gauge student progress in advance of annual state exams. These assessments have spawned growing debate among educators, assessment experts, and the testing industry: are they worth the significant investment of money and time? In Making the Most of Interim Assessment Data: Lessons from Philadelphia, Research for Action (RFA) weighs in on this issue. The School District of Philadelphia (SDP) was an early adopter of interim assessments, implementing the exams in 2003. Unlike teachers in some other regions, Philadelphia elementary and middle grades teachers rated these 'Benchmark' assessments highly. However, the study found that enthusiasm did not necessarily correlate with higher rates of student achievement. What did predict student success were three factors--instructional leadership, collective responsibility, and use of the SDP's Core Curriculum.

AB  - Induction refers to the process in which people generalize their previous experience when making uncertain inferences about the environment that go beyond direct experience. Here we show that interim tests strongly enhance inductive learning. Participants studied the painting styles of eight famous artists across four lists, each comprising paintings by one pair of artists. In an interim test group participants' induction was tested after each list. In two control groups participants solved math problems (interim math group) or studied additional new paintings (interim study group) following each of Lists 1-3 and were asked to classify new paintings on List 4. In the List 4 interim test, the interim test group significantly outperformed the other two groups, indicating that interim testing enhances new inductive learning. In a final cumulative test, accuracy in the interim test group at classifying new paintings by studied artists was nearly double that of the other two groups, indicating the major importance of interim testing in inductive learning. This enhancing effect of interim testing on inductive learning was associated with metacognitive awareness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Experimental Psychology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect that a formative instructional and assessment program had on student academic growth and achievement. Students from the treatment school, which implemented a formative instructional and assessment program, were compared to students from ten non-treatment schools with similar demographics and geographic locale. Two separate ANOVAs were used to evaluate academic growth and achievement. The first ANOVA compared mean scores for 91 students from the treatment school with 94 students from the comparison schools for AIMS reading and math. The analysis revealed that the AIMS reading and math mean scores were significantly higher for the treatment school than the comparison schools. The second ANOVA compared mean scores for the 77 students from the treatment school with 80 students from the comparison schools for student growth percentiles (SGPs), a new achievement measure, in math and reading. Results indicated that the treatment school students overall had significantly better SGPs than comparison students. Two major conclusions emerged from the predicted achievement area of this study. First, schools that use formative assessment instructional practices will have higher AIMS test scores than non-formative assessment comparison schools. Second, schools that use formative assessment instructional practices will have higher student growth than non-formative assessment comparison schools.

AB  - The need for a scientifically-literate American population has gained great prominence on the educational landscape of priorities over the past decade; young children will be increasingly exposed to the STEM fields and encouraged to excel in these areas. Professional development is key to assuring that early childhood teachers provide children with cognitively-challenging early learning experiences. Focusing on the Head Start community, "Foundations of Science Literacy" (FSL) is a credit-bearing professional development course that directly addresses the achievement gap in early science education. The program not only addresses an urgent need, it also integrates the resources, structure, and support that preschool teachers need to improve early science learning and teaching. First, based on data from an efficacy study nearing completion, the authors assess whether "FSL without" embedded formative assessments leads to gains in preschool children. Second, drawing on insights from a new development project, the authors describe how instruction-embedded formative assessment can be used to "strengthen" and "clarify" the relation between gains in teacher pedagogical content knowledge and gains in children's scientific thinking. For the efficacy study, FSL was implemented in the greater New York City area and the population included preschool teachers and a sample of children in their classrooms using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The authors highlight a promising approach to learning from mixed (summative) results using formative assessment to provide more nuanced information about children's learning over time and to allow teachers to tailor instruction so that it is more effective. One figure is appended.

AB  - Response to intervention (RTI) is on the radar screen of most principals these days--finding out what it is, how it can improve teaching and learning, and what needs to be done to implement it effectively. One critical component of RTI that will require particular attention from principals is student progress monitoring, which is required in every tier of RTI. The most commonly used and well-researched method of monitoring progress is curriculum-based measurement (CBM). This article defines CBM, describes how it works, and cites its effects on the achievement of students with learning disabilities. (Contains 3 online resources.)

AB  - This article describes the theory, key components, and empirical support for the Classroom Strategies Coaching (CSC) Model, a data-driven coaching approach that systematically integrates data from multiple observations to identify teacher practice needs and goals, design practice plans, and evaluate progress towards goals. The primary aim of the model is to improve teachers' use of specific evidenced-based instructional and behavioral management practices at the claxsssroom level. Key components of the model include integration of instruction and classroom behavior management; brief structured problem solving framework; formative assessment with a validated observation instrument; establishing measurable goals; and visual performance feedback. Results from a randomized controlled study offer emerging evidence of the potential impact of formative assessment and coaching on teacher classroom practices in elementary schools. Additionally, we offer recommendations for future research and practice.

AB  - The effectiveness of three types of structured reviews of mathematical concepts was compared in this study. The three types of reviews were testing only, testing with explanations, and unit review. The experimental population consisted of 55 members of two sixth-grade classes, 94 members of 4 eighth-grade classes, 36 members of two Algebra II classes, and 16 college freshmen. Subjects were assigned randomly within classes to treatment groups. Treatment was given on two consecutive days; on the third day an achievement test was given. Two weeks later (one week for college students) a retention test was given. Test scores were submitted to a repeated measures analysis of variance. This analysis showed that at all levels except high school the reviews enhanced learning. Testing with explanation was the most promising treatment, and testing-only the least promising. (SD)

AB  - The quiz and knowledge of results on the quiz have generally been found to be effective in enhancing classroom learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of quizzing on achievement, with or without feedback. In three experimental sections quizzes were given immediately after the lesson; in three other sections quizzes were given the day after the feedback. The three conditions being used were: correct answers being given immediately; correct answers given the day after the quiz; and only the number of correct answers given to the student the following day. There was also a control section. It was found that sections receiving the delayed quiz did better on the final examination than those receiving an intermediate quiz. A short daily quiz administered one day after a lecture serves to evaluate for the student mathemagenic behaviors in which he engages during the delay. When knowledge of results is delayed, mathemagenic behaviors are also engaged in, but it is the quiz material that is being processed rather than the lecture material. The utilization of mathemagenic behaviors by the student varies according to his achievement orientation. A bibliography is appended. (Author)

AB  - The current study examined the utilization of precision teaching with students who have sustained a traumatic brain injury. This study is important because there are increasing numbers of students in our schools who have received such injuries. The results of an injury may cause a decrease in reading fluency and there is an increasing demand for evidence-based research that improves academic skills. The study provided a way to measure the effectiveness of interventions utilizing Precision Teaching. Precision Teaching, which is a visual display of measures of academic behaviors such as words read per minute, is the method chosen for this study. The nine students in this study were second, third, and fourth grade students from a single school district. These students qualified to receive specialized reading interventions and instruction based on scores from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Learning Skills (DIBELS). Three of the nine students had sustained a brain injury. Their progress in reading fluency was recorded using Precision Teaching techniques. In addition, students, parents and their teachers were asked questions to obtain their perceptions regarding reading and feelings regarding taking measurements of their academic skills. Results indicated student skills in reading single sight words increased with daily measurements and recording their progress. Their interest in reading books increased and their feelings about themselves also increased. Parents and homeroom teachers noticed improved effort and interest in reading. Their reading specialists did not notice as much improvement. Students with a TBI increased skills at similar rate to those in the study without an injury. There was a difference in the interest in reading with two of the three TBI students reporting no increased time spent reading. The three students with a TBI involved in the study felt they improved and enjoyed reading more than previously. Results of this study suggest Precision Teaching as a visual display of data did increase interest and targeted reading skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many urban districts have adopted interim assessments in recent years as a supplement to annual testing. Possible purposes for such tests include monitoring and assisting student progress, aligning the curriculum, and practicing for state exams, but little is known about how effectively real systems advance these purposes. The Providence Public School District (PPSD) implemented a system of quarterly assessments at every grade starting in 2004 and discontinued them in 2007. During the implementation period, authors interviewed district officials about what they were trying to accomplish, and teachers and other school personnel about their experiences with the assessments and their use of the results. Evidence of effectiveness as well as limitations were found. Uncertainty about the magnitude of positive impacts raised questions about the net value of the assessments given their considerable costs to districts, teachers, and students. The authors conclude that interim assessments are costly, and costs increase if the desired effects on student achievement require significant investments in professional development of teachers. Sound policy, therefore, should be carefully designed and evaluated. Two appendixes are included: (1) Interview Protocol; and (2) Findings from Interviews and Survey. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - This study examined the impact of a content-area vocabulary assessment system and data collection process on third-grade students, with particular emphasis on English Language Learners and at-risk readers. A treatment group and a control group were each administered a pretest and posttest consisting of essential content-area vocabulary. The treatment group participated in a weekly content vocabulary assessment and data collection process within a district-developed vocabulary program. Teachers in the treatment group also utilized the processes of continuous improvement from the quality movement in their classrooms. Students in the treatment group showed statistically significant gains, as compared to students in the control group. Treatment teachers also were observed and interviewed for evidence of changes in their instructional practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Treatment sessions occurred twice weekly for a total of 6 weeks, and multilevel modeling was used to examine progress across intervention sessions. Results suggested that combining cover-copy-compare with goal setting (problems correct) leads to steeper slopes and higher final scores than most other treatment conditions, the effects of which were retained over 1 month and generalized to similar stimulus conditions. Initial scores on a third-grade general outcome measure significantly affected growth over time but not final score. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In the field of science education, inquiry-based learning is advocated to be a promising method for teaching science concepts. Its benefits with regard to retaining content knowledge seem to be particularly unclear, and suitable means for ensuring retention have not yet been found. Research from cognitive psychology points to the benefit of retrieval-based learning for the retention of scientific content. With the purpose of improving science education, the present study aims to analyse the efficacy of this instructional technique for the retention of scientific concepts. Therefore, a study involving 6th and 7th graders (N = 93) was conducted. An inquiry activity which includes retrieval-based learning was compared with inquiry tasks that incorporate rereading or no extra guidance (control) to build up content knowledge about the biological concept of adaptation. Overall, retrieval-practice and rereading outperformed the control condition, indicating the need for embedding learning techniques that increase access to domain information during inquiry. However, retrieval practice and rereading did not differ significantly, although different types of learners benefited from the learning techniques on a longterm basis. The results are discussed concerning their theoretical relevance and practical implications.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to examine and evaluate the importance of three variables of Bloom's mastery learning model. The variables studied were specification of objectives, use of diagnostic-progress (d-p) tests, and use of alternate resources. The study used four seventh grade and four eighth grade classes; each grade classes were pretested each semester on course objectives. There was no significant difference among the classes at the .25 level. Each class took chapter, unit, and semester (posttest) exams based on the objectives. The first semester eighth grade classes received four different treatments: no variables (control class), behavioral objectives, objectives and daily ungraded d-p tests with recommendations, objectives and d-p tests with recommendations that included alternate resources. There was a significant difference between the control class and each treatment class. Using second semester seventh grade classes, a comparison between a control class and a class using daily ungraded d-p tests with recommendations was significant at the .05 level. The results indicate that the use of either a list of specific objectives or d-p tests with recommendations is sufficient for a significant increase in student mastery of the objectives. The second semester seventh grade classes received four different treatments: no variables, general objectives, specific objectives, and daily ungraded d-p tests with recommendations. There was a significant difference between classes using specific and general objectives at the .10 level. (Author/DB)

AB  - Test-enhanced learning is a technique instructors can use to increase recall on summative assessments (e.g., exams) via formative assessments (e.g., quizzes). The present research examined recommendations based on the transfer-appropriate processing and level-of-processing (LOP) perspectives to assess the question, does deeper processing on quizzes (i.e., using application questions compared to factual) benefit exam performance? Students were more likely to correctly answer application questions on the exam when quizzes required a deeper LOP, and students appeared to gain a relatively equivalent definitional understanding using either factual or application questions on quizzes. Consequently, the present research supports the use of quiz questions that require a deeper LOP, especially when students are expected to learn beyond rote memorization.

AB  - This report presents detailed information about the student assessment results of the Colorado Student Assessment Program. Included among the data is information on student achievement by gender, ethnicity or race, disability, and accommodation categories. In addition, achievement data are presented for each school district and for schools categorized by socioeconomic status. The 1999-2000 school year represented a year of change for the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP), with the most notable development being the addition of several new assessments. For the first time, mathematics was assessed at grade 5 and mathematics and science at grade 8, bringing the total of assessments to 11 administered at 5 grade levels. The addition of the new assessments provides a baseline for measuring continual growth as students progress towards proficiency on the Colorado Model Content Standards. The results indicate that 47% of students were at or above proficient levels for fifth grade mathematics, with 33% and 45% respectively at or above proficient levels in eighth grade mathematics and science. For the first time, results of the assessments of Spanish speakers are included in the annual report. Results on other CSAP assessments show the continued progress of Colorado's students toward the standards. Students have improved in several areas, including third grade reading, fourth and seventh grade reading and writing. The report on assessment results is presented in these sections: (1) third grade reading comprehension in English and Spanish; (2) fourth grade reading in English and Spanish; (3) fourth grade writing in English and Spanish; (4) fifth grade mathematics; (5) seventh grade reading; (6) seventh grade writing; (7) eighth grade mathematics; and (8) eighth grade science. An appendix contains performance and proficiency level descriptors for the various grades and subjects. (Contains 74 tables.) (SLD)

AB  - There is limited research demonstrating direct instruction (DI) as an effective language intervention for students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and developmental disabilities (DD). Existing research has shown that instruction using partial implementation of DI programs resulted in student learning (Ganz, 2007) and instruction using whole lessons resulted in positive instructional effects for students with ASD and DD (Ganz, 2007). However, it is not known whether DI is more effective than other language interventions. The purpose of this study was to compare DI to an established intervention, discrete trial teaching. Thirteen students with ASD or participated in the study and data were collected using curriculum-based assessment. An independent samplest-test indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in student performance for the group who received DI. Results and their implications will be discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative causal-comparative study was to examine if and to what extent statistically significant differences existed between CDT formative assessment adopters and CDT formative assessment non-adopters in reading and mathematics achievement of Title I grade 8 as measured by the 2011 to 2012 change in school-level PSSA performance in urban Pennsylvania. Bloom's mastery learning theory underpins the adoption of CDT for formative assessment and learning outcomes of school-level achievement. The two research questions asked whether statistically significant differences existed between CDT formative assessment adopters and non-adopters in reading achievement (or mathematics achievement) of Title I middle school grade 8 as measured by the change in school-level PSSA performance. Upon outlier exclusion, the final study sample was 189 eligible Title I schools (n1 = 61, n2 = 128). The sample represented 25.33% of the target population of 746 consecutive eligible status Title I schools containing grade 8 in Pennsylvania. Results of two independent samples t-test at 0.05 significance level showed no statistical significant difference among CDT adopters and non-adopters in terms of Delta_Reading, t(187) = -0.81, p = .419, and Delta_Math, t(187) = -0.96, p = .339. As districts adopt technology-based programs to aid in school-level achievement, the impact of school-wide adoption, and the influence of school climate on student motivation and closing the achievement gap needs further study.

AB  - Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) is a well established tool for formative assessment. CBM has also been used for prediction of state test scores. However, validity coefficients between math-CBM and state tests have been moderate at best (Skiba, Magnusson, Martson, and Erickson, 1986; Martson, 1989; Putnam, 1989). The purpose of the present investigation was to develop and evaluate a set of math assessments designed to measure the type of application and problem-solving objectives required on state tests. The application assessments constructed for this study combined characteristics of CBM, accuracy-based curriculum-based assessment (CBA) and criterion-referenced assessment (CRA). Theses assessments were derived from state standards and matched to local district curriculum. The methodology involved obtaining validity coefficients for (a) traditional CBM assessments versus (b) newly developed assessments which incorporated applications/problem-solving with regard to “state tests” which served as a standard against which (a) and (b) above could be evaluated. The assessments examined included (a) one single skill computation assessment, (b) one multiple skill computation assessment, (c) one maze reading assessment, (d) a newly constructed applications assessment, (e) Woodcock-Johnson III math subtests, (f) Louisiana Education Program for the 21 st Century (LEAP), and (g) the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS). Additionally, the various assessments were investigated relative to teacher-based indicators including (a) students' final grades, (b) teacher report of year end performance, and (c) teacher preference of math assessments. Participants included 172 first to fifth grade regular education students who were administered the CBM/CBA/CRA assessments one month following the state tests. State testing included use of the LEAP in fourth grade and the ITBS in second, third and fifth grades. Results indicated that the newly developed application assessment exhibited a stronger relationship with the criterion assessments, with students' final grades, and teacher report of year-end performance. In addition, the application type assessments were preferred over the computation assessments by all teachers. Results and limitations are discussed with regard to the construction and use of an application-oriented CBM/CBA/CRA for users needing assessment which might combine the power of formative evaluation with the ability to accurately predict performance on state tests.

AB  - Evaluations of compensatory educational programs reveal that Black and Chicano school children do relatively less well the longer they remain in school. This investigation sought to determine the extent to which this regression is attributable to contemporary evaluation methodology. Analysis was conducted of the impact of standardized achievement tests on a population of low SES Black and Chicano fifth grade students. It was hypothesized that the effect of frequent testing would be that of depressing achievement test scores. Analysis determined that the typical student dropped an average of two stanines in reading achievement as a result of this testing. Additionally, this study found that: (1) Black and Chicano children learn more than standardized tests show; (2) Testing is a high stress activity; and (3) Testing seriously impairs the teacher-student relationship. Research was conducted through structured classroom observations and interviews and interval analysis of test scores. It is concluded that standardized testing produces primary and secondary reactive effects which are destructive to self-confidence, achievement, and the academic ability of minority, low-income children.

AB  - Title III of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) requires state education agencies to develop progress and attainment benchmarks for school districts, called annual measurable achievement objectives (AMAOs), for English language learners (ELLs). AMAOs must be based on annual assessments of English proficiency in the domains of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Conceptually, holding districts accountable for ELL student progress and attainment in English seems straightforward. However, the process for establishing AMAO criteria can be very complex, and current research on system accountability using ELL assessments is sparse at best. Because of this dearth of research, there has been little guidance available to inform states on how to appropriately establish AMAO policies. This paper attempts to fill that void by providing guidance and recommendations on how states might establish AMAO progress and English attainment policies. The first section of the paper provides guidance for AMAO 1--targeted annual increases in the number or percentage of children making progress in learning English. The second section provides guidance for AMAO 2--targeted annual increases in the number or percentage of children attaining English proficiency. The third section offers some alternative approaches to setting AMAO 1 criteria. The data used in this paper come from three member states of the World-class Instructional Design and Assessment (WIDA) Consortium over a 3-year period (2005-2007) across all grades (kindergarten to 12th grade). The WIDA Consortium was originally established with funding from a U.S. Department of Education Enhanced Assessment Grant and includes 17 states. The English language proficiency assessment used by WIDA Consortium states is ACCESS for ELLs[R] (Assessing Comprehension and Communication in English State to State). This assessment is aligned with WIDA English proficiency standards and reflects the state-specific academic content standards of member states as required under NCLB. The AMAO recommendations made in this paper relate specifically to states using ACCESS for ELLs[R]; however, the methods, recommendations, and guidance offered are easily generalizable to other types of ELL assessment systems. (Contains 13 tables and 19 figures.)

AB  - Formative assessment is important for improving student learning in all classrooms and can be easily facilitated in large classes by personal response systems (clickers). A critical component of formative assessment is the feedback associated with it. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the amount of feedback that is critical and sufficient to improve student exam performance. To address this goal, a mixed methods approach was employed to examine how students performed on course exams in relation to the use of low-, mid-, and high-level clicker questions asked in class, as well as the detail of feedback they received immediately following each class. Low-level questions included fact-based and comprehension questions, mid-level questions involved the application of concepts, and high-level questions included analysis of data and evaluation of arguments. The results showed that while students appreciate the preparation for exam questions afforded by the clicker questions, there is no simple correlation in students’ performance between the difficulty of the clicker and exam questions. Furthermore, the feedback given to students did not have any statistically significant effect on their exam performance. Many limitations and confounding factors may have inhibited the significance in these results, including changes in the instructor’s in-class feedback for the clicker questions and dilution of the effect of the feedback and clicker questions by all of the other study materials provided to students. Implications regarding the relationship between the level of difficulty of clicker questions asked in class versus the exam, as well as suggestions for providing immediate but varied feedback are discussed.

AB  - Background: The testing effect is the finding that information that is retrieved during learning is more often correctly retrieved on a final test than information that is restudied. According to the semantic mediator hypothesis the testing effect arises because retrieval practice of cue-target pairs (mother-child) activates semantically related mediators (father) more than restudying. Hence, the mediator-target (father-child) association should be stronger for retrieved than restudied pairs. Indeed, Carpenter (2011) found a larger testing effect when participants received mediators (father) than when they received target-related words (birth) as final test cues. Methods: The present study started as an attempt to test an alternative account of Carpenter’s results. However, it turned into a series of conceptual (Experiment 1) and direct (Experiment 2 and 3) replications conducted with online samples. The results of these online replications were compared with those of similar existing laboratory experiments through small-scale meta-analyses. Results: The results showed that (1) the magnitude of the raw mediator testing effect advantage is comparable for online and laboratory experiments, (2) in both online and laboratory experiments the magnitude of the raw mediator testing effect advantage is smaller than in Carpenter’s original experiment, and (3) the testing effect for related cues varies considerably between online experiments. Conclusions: The variability in the testing effect for related cues in online experiments could point toward moderators of the related cue short-term testing effect. The raw mediator testing effect advantage is smaller than in Carpenter’s original experiment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The combination of a hands-on approach to science with the accountability of daily assessments provides a greater opportunity for students who traditionally receive below-average grades to be successful in science classes. The addition of competitive elements and real world applications plays to their strengths as kinesthetic learners without sacrificing the rigor required to meet graduation standards. Further, daily assessment allows students to develop test-taking skills they will need for the standardized tests used by the state and for college admission. Finally, the combination of daily feedback and daily accountability prevents a struggling student from slipping through the cracks.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of formative standards-based assessments on learning in a mathematics classroom. This study looked particularly at the ways in which ongoing formative assessments could be used to inform a teacher about the learning of students in their classroom, as well as the instructional decision-making made based on the outcomes of those assessments. Using frequent and ongoing formative standards-based assessments, this study tracked the performance of learners in four eighth grade classrooms to answer the following questions:(1)How does a middle school math teacher use daily formative assessments aligned to standards to identify and support gaps in student learning and communicate progress to students?(2)In what ways does a middle school math teacher use a daily formative standards-based assessment to adjust practice?Using state standardized testing scores from the prior two years (SY 2017-18 and 2018-19), a pre- and posttest, as well as daily formative standards-based assessments, the researcher quantitatively tracked the levels of student learning for 65 students over the course of one unit of study in the 2019-2020 school year. The study did produce evidence of improved student learning among a subgroup of students who had previously shown to be making less than grade-level progress, as well as providing direction for educators in adjusting practice driven by data gathered from formative standards-based assessments.

AB  - Vertical equating of a large urban school district's curriculum-based achievement tests for students in grades one through five was performed by using the BILOG-MG software package produced by Zimowski, Muraki, Mislevy, and Bock. This software extends the application of the item response theory (IRT) approach to test analysis to testing situations involving multiple groups. Using BILOG-MG, item parameter estimates were derived using a marginal maximum a posteriori approach in combination with an expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). Estimates of examinee ability were produced using the Bayesian, or expected a posteriori, estimate with a normal prior distribution. Linkage of successive test forms was accomplished by administering a common set of items to students at two successive grade levels, thereby providing estimation of the relative mean of each group of respondents, based on their responses both to the common items and to their own grade level items. Using aggregated data, a raw score to scale score conversion was created that placed each possible raw score on a grade-level test onto a continuum that extended across the grades.

AB  - This dissertation was designed to examine elementary teacher use of formative assessment and the impact formative assessment may have on student achievement as measured by benchmark assessments. The study was conducted in a school district in northwestern North Carolina. The teachers in this study have had NCFALCON training in the use of formative assessment but may not be implementing formative assessment to its fullest potential within their everyday instruction. As research regarding formative assessment indicates increased student achievement, it is important to know if teachers are using formative assessment to its fullest potential. The study used teacher and student surveys on the use of formative assessment as well as ClassScape® reading and math common district benchmark results of the students surveyed. Using data from the surveys, the researcher compared the teacher ratings of the use of formative assessment to student ratings of teacher use of formative assessment as well as comparing both sets of survey data to benchmark scores. An analysis of variance and a regression analysis were used in this study. The data from these analyses revealed that students rated teachers more highly in the use of formative assessment. The analyses also indicate that student perception of the teacher's use of formative assessment may predict reading benchmark scores. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - By using the preliminary guidelines set forth in previous research for the formative evaluation of academic progress using curriculum-based measurement (CBM) procedures, the present research tested the "goodness of fit" of those guidelines for use with first grade students in the regular education classroom. Group C consisted of 63 first grade students in three classrooms who were administered CBM math probes twice, once in the fall and once in the spring, as part of a larger school-wide norming study. Group M consisted of 19 first grade students who were monitored weekly by their classroom teacher using the same CBM math probes. Academic growth rates were analyzed using multiple regression procedures. Student slopes were examined to determine how well linear and quadratic relationships modeled student progress. The results supported the generalizability of past findings to a similar grade and population. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This study sought to determine the significance of Curriculum Based Assessment (CBA) with respect to its affect on achievement and specific classroom behaviors of high school students in general mathematics classes. Thirty low achieving students were subjectively identified by the teachers participating in the study and assigned to matched pairs. Group A received CBA interventions while Group B continued with traditional instruction. Achievement was measured by teacher grades, a standardized measure (Stanford Test of Academic Skills), and the Nevada State Mathematics Proficiency Examination. Classroom behaviors were rated by independent observers measuring time on task, tasks completed, and tasks comprehended. Two classrooms constituted the treatment/control settings in which four classes were taught by two teachers at different times during the regular school day. The only difference was that the experimental group received the CBA learning packets. Findings indicated that there was clear statistical evidence supporting greater improvement in the experimental group than in the control group in terms of teacher grades and task completion efforts. For the Nevada State Mathematics Proficiency Examination and the Standford Test of Academic Skills, both groups experienced statistically significant gains from pretest to posttest results. There were no significant differences in gain scores, however, between the groups. In terms of on-task and task comprehension, it was found that there was no significant difference between groups on these two variables. From the matched pair analysis, it should be noted that in general, more subjects in the experimental group performed better than their counterparts in the control group for all six variables. This pattern was even evident for variables in which there was no statistically significant difference between groups.

AB  - Five full-time online mathematics instructors participated in a study to test the impact of using discussion forums as a space for formative assessments. Mean student posting activity and student quiz scores for sections in which the instructors used formative assessments were compared with previous sections in which formative assessments were not used. The research indicates that online discussion forums can be an important part of the learning process. Specifically, a certain type of formative assessment, known as classroom assessment techniques (Cross and Angelo 1988), may actually elicit more discussion forum conversation from students and positively impact student quiz scores.

AB  - Increasingly, educational reform efforts are turning towards data-driven decision making strategies to help teachers improve instruction through skills-based instruction/content that is both measurable and aligned to common rigorous standards, such as the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Examining the impact of a formative online assessment system on a summative measurement of student achievement may provide evidence that data-driven instructional platforms can impact student achievement and learning outcomes. Guided by the theoretical frameworks of Vygotsky and Dewey, along with the concepts of multiple intelligence, constructivism, and mastery learning, this study examined the relationship between student scores from an online formative assessment administered quarterly and an end-of-year summative evaluation. A stepwise multiple regression analyzed the predictive power of the iReady formative assessment program towards archived SAT-10 reading and mathematics data among Grades 1-4 students, before and after the iReady program was implemented (N = 339). The results showed a significant relationship between the iReady program and SAT-10, explaining 11.6% of the variance in SAT-10 scores. The study's intended audience is educators, school districts, and policy makers who are using the achievement data produced by formative assessments to improve results on measures of academic achievement, leading to positive social change.

AB  - Increasingly, educational reform efforts are turning towards data-driven decision making strategies to help teachers improve instruction through skills-based instruction/content that is both measurable and aligned to common rigorous standards, such as the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Examining the impact of a formative online assessment system on a summative measurement of student achievement may provide evidence that data-driven instructional platforms can impact student achievement and learning outcomes. Guided by the theoretical frameworks of Vygotsky and Dewey, along with the concepts of multiple intelligence, constructivism, and mastery learning, this study examined the relationship between student scores from an online formative assessment administered quarterly and an end-of-year summative evaluation. A stepwise multiple regression analyzed the predictive power of the iReady formative assessment program towards archived SAT-10 reading and mathematics data among Grades 1-4 students, before and after the iReady program was implemented (N = 339). The results showed a significant relationship between the iReady program and SAT-10, explaining 11.6% of the variance in SAT-10 scores. The study's intended audience is educators, school districts, and policy makers who are using the achievement data produced by formative assessments to improve results on measures of academic achievement, leading to positive social change.

AB  - Two experiments investigated the acquisition of course material under conditions of repeated testing. In Experiment I, with limited study intervals, acquisition increased over trials of study followed by testing. In addition, adjunct information about the content of the test item pool also increased performance. In Experiment II, with student determined study intervals, there was little or no change in performance associated with repeated testing. (Author)

AB  - Scope and Method of Study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the word level composition of curriculum-based measurement reading passages significantly impacted the oral reading fluency performance of at-risk readers. Specifically, the impact of high-frequency and decodable words was evaluated on first-, second-, and third-grade students' absolute reading rate and growth profiles. In the current study, passages containing significantly different levels of high-frequency and decodable words were administered to two groups of students eight times over the course of four weeks. Students read aloud from the passages for one minute and words correct per minute were calculated. Findings and Conclusions. Results from a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that the percentage of high-frequency and decodable words did not significantly impact either absolute reading rate or reading growth profiles. Visual inspection of grade level data suggested that differences might exist in the reading performance of students who read from the high-frequency and those who read from decodable passages; however, insufficient power prevented statistical analyses of these grade-level differences. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated the effects of a criterion-referenced model of curriculum-based assessment (CBA) on the rates of social studies skill acquisition in secondary level students with learning disabilities. CBA was implemented with six students, aged 12-14 years, across two academic tasks: locating countries on a blank map and matching the names of countries with their capital cities. A multiple baseline design was used, and the order in which CBA was implemented across the two tasks was counterbalanced to control for sequence effects. During the experimental phase, students set outcome goals, constructed their own graphs, and plotted their daily scores on graphs. The results of the study indicated that CBA increased students' rates of skill acquisition for both of the academic tasks, but this was true only when students mastered the skill of locating countries prior to attempting to match the names of countries with capital cities. When students attempted to master the matching task without first mastering the map location task, they were not successful. The findings corroborated previous research regarding the use of CBA for increasing student achievement. CBA was shown to be a robust technique through its successful use with a new population (secondary level students with learning disabilities). The CBA methodology also proved to have a motivating effect on students. Implications for theory included support for CBA as an effective teaching behavior that provides for student success through the establishment of optimal conditions for learning. Research implications included the difficulty of conducting formative evaluation on a daily basis, and an alternative schedule was recommended. Practical implications included the efficacy of CBA in measuring performance in social studies, the appropriateness of using a criterion-referenced model of CBA in social studies, the importance of empirically supported skill sequences, and the relevance of CBA to both general and special educators.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe passage effects on "Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills--Next Edition Oral Reading Fluency" ("DIBELS Next ORF") progress-monitoring measures for Grades 1 through 6. Approximately 572 students per grade (total "N" with at least one data point = 3,092) read all three "DIBELS Next" winter benchmark passages in the prescribed order, and within 2 weeks read four additional progress-monitoring passages in a randomly assigned and counterbalanced order. All 20 progress-monitoring passages were read by students in Grades 1 through 4; 16 passages were read in Grade 5 and 12 passages were read in Grade 6. Results focus on the persistence of form effects in spite of a priori criteria used in passage development. The authors describe the utility of three types of equating methods (i.e., mean, linear, and equipercentile equating) in ameliorating these effects. Their conclusions focus on preferred equating methods with small samples, the impact of form effects on progress-monitoring decision making, and recommendations for future use of ORF passages for progress monitoring.

Completing frequent quizzes can improve exam scores; however, there is a lack of research on variables that influence quiz accuracy and whether there is an effect on exam scores. This study evaluated the effects of a contingency for quiz accuracy on quiz accuracy and exam performance. Eighty-one students enrolled in an introductory Learning course participated. For each class meeting and its related readings, the instructor assigned an online quiz due just before each class. During the no-contingency condition, the instructor assigned quizzes, but quiz accuracy did not result in points toward the final grade. During the accuracy-contingency condition, students earned points based on quiz accuracy. In a reversal design, the accuracy-contingency increased quiz accuracy and exam scores relative to no-contingency. Although many students benefited from the contingency, low-performing students were least likely to show a meaningful improvement in exam scores.

AB  - This article presents key findings from a Joint Information Systems Committee-funded project, which aimed to identify existing practices where technologies contribute to formative assessment and identify processes that take place around formative assessment where technologies play a significant role. Using a design pattern methodology, the project developed a range of cases of formative e-assessment with practitioners across a variety of settings through a series of participant workshops. From a selection of these cases, we identified key elements in how practitioners described the problems and solutions they addressed regarding assessment in relation to learning within their different contexts. The patterns were analysed to highlight aspects of them, which are considered critical in theoretical analyses of formative assessment. We provide an overview of the project and discuss an illustrative case and pattern, followed by an analysis which suggests the particular contribution of technologies to formative assessment. Ultimately, for assessment to have formative effects, tutors and students can be identified as appropriating both social and technological resources in learning situations and engaging with both to learn how to take control over learning experiences.

AB  - This investigation was conducted to determine the validity of the use of Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) as a tool in formative curriculum evaluation. The instructional materials were selected from 1968 grade seven materials produced by the Intermediate Science Curriculum Study (ISCS). The comparison of student performance within these instructional materials was made between CAI (20) and non-CAI students. The non-CAI student sample consisted of 40 students from several schools using ISCS materials. A test battery which included the California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) and the Metropolitan Achievement Test - Reading (MAT) was given to all subjects. In addition, the Lincoln-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency was given to CAI students. The questions within the ISCS instructional sequence were classified into eight process categories. The number of correct responses to the questions within each of the categories was considered to be a measure of student performance. Student performance in each of the categories was correlated with logical reasoning, reading and general ability measures. The change in correlations between the first half and second half of the instructional sequence was not significant in 22 of the 24 cases. The results of the study indicate that CAI and non-CAI student performance was similar with the ISCS materials. (Author/PS)

In the first part of the article we develop a rationale for the approach to formative assessment employed in this research. Our results are derived from testing this approach in three schools using control and intervention groups. In the light of these results we comment on some dichotomies in assessment and learning that have been suggested in previous research.

AB  - This paper reports on the effectiveness of an innovative course design that bridges classes from two different disciplines. The "Bridge" design creates assignments in two classes: a summary class and a panel class. The design encourages students to engage in teaching and interacting with their peers within and across disciplines, and provides instructors with unique opportunities for formative assessment. Relative to control groups, students in the summary class perceived greater opportunities to teach peers, participate in class discussions, think critically, and engage in collaborative learning. Students in the panel class showed gains in critical thinking. Both classes afforded multiple opportunities for formative assessment. Following a discussion of the results, recommendations for improving the "Bridge" design are presented.

AB  - Practicing retrieval can improve the updating or modification of existing knowledge. When students need to update their existing knowledge, performing retrieval practice on the first set of materials often strengthens learning of the next set. However, Davis and Chan (2015) reported that interpolated testing can sometimes impair new learning. Here, we examined whether frequently switching between retrieval of previously learned material and encoding of new material can disrupt learning of the new material. In the current experiment, participants either switched between restudying originally learned items and new learning or between retrieving originally learned items and new learning, and we varied the frequency with which task switching occurred. We found that interpolating retrieval, but not restudy, with new learning impaired new learning. These results are consistent with the idea that retrieval practice and encoding rely on different cognitive processes, and intermixing them can exert a cost.

AB  - The birth of the writing process movement in the 1970‘s revolutionized the way educators think about writing instruction. The reintroduction in the 1990‘s of formative assessment as an instructional technique for improving student achievement transformed pedagogical theory underlying evaluation. Both movements represent a shift in focus from product to process, yet paradoxically this occurs at a time when there has never been more attention paid to accountability for student achievement as measured by performance in exams. This apparent contradiction results in educators having to create a balance between known 'best pedagogical practices‘ that are process oriented while keeping a keen eye on the outcomes – measurable student achievement. In the senior high classroom, particularly during the graduating year, emerging knowledge of informed pedagogy is often submerged by the pressing concern of final exams. Writing the critical essay is the greatest challenge facing students in their final year, particularly as students are faced with the knowledge that essay writing is the most popular form of writing assessment occurring throughout high school and college. In this circumstance, establishing authentic learning experiences in critical thinking and writing is a complex undertaking. This inquiry presents the results of a three year action research study of the assessment practices of an English Language Arts team of teachers of which this author was the Learning Leader. The purpose was to investigate how intentional formative assessment strategies in the teaching of writing, with a focus on the critical essay, could affect student engagement, motivation and achievement and to identify key strategies that might produce this effect. Beginning with a conceptual framework based on a music instruction paradigm where modelling, peer and self-appraisal and focussed practice are key elements, the inquiry took the form of blending elements of the writing process with formative assessment strategies. A conceptual framework, the Interactive Dynamic Modelling Process that places inquiry into a writing form at the centre was developed as a unique and effective way of drawing together essential elements of formative assessment and writing instruction. The implementation of this model was shown to have positive effects on student engagement and achievement.

AB  - • Tier 2 intervention in math might improve students' at-risk performance. • First to third-grade at-risk students might benefit from number sense based math intervention. • Children at risk in math might benefit from an explicit and systematic intervention. • Teachers are able to implement intervention programs with a high level of fidelity. • Interventionist teachers increase the generability of intervention studies results. This study explored the efficacy of a Tier 2 intervention within the context of the Response to Intervention (RtI) model implemented by Spanish first- to third-grade primary school teachers to improve at-risk students' early math skills. Teachers were instructed in the administration of a math curriculum-based measure composed of 5 isolated measures (quantity discrimination, missing number, single-digit computation, multidigit computation, and place value) to identify at-risk students and to monitor their progress; and in the implementation of a systematic and explicit instructional program to improve basic math skills in at-risk students. Implementation fidelity was analyzed using direct observations and self-reports. The intervention was conducted with adequate fidelity and had a significant positive impact on all grades. Significant differences were found between experimental and control students at risk of math failure in the improvement rate of quantity discrimination, missing number, and place value in all grades. Experimental at-risk students showed a monthly improvement, assessed using a combination of screening and progress monitoring measures. In conclusion, Spanish first to third graders at risk of math failure benefited from a Tier 2 intervention based on basic math skills, implemented by in-service teachers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Eighty-three students enrolled in general education classrooms and 62 Spanish-speaking English language learners (ELLs) enrolled in bilingual education classrooms were assessed in reading English three times a year using curriculum-based measurement. Fluency in Spanish passages were also assessed for Spanish-speaking ELLs in the bilingual education program. Results showed that Spanish-speaking ELLs read less fluently on English passages than general education students across grades and across testing periods. When general education students reading in English and Spanish-speaking ELLs reading in Spanish were compared, general education students read more fluently in English than Spanish-speaking ELLs did in Spanish. In addition, general education students made more gains over time in reading English than Spanish-speaking ELLs reading in Spanish. These findings suggest that curriculum-based measurement can be a viable methodology for evaluating the rate of progress of Spanish-speaking ELLs in bilingual education programs. In addition, the study points to the need for more research to determine the expected rates of gain in reading among Spanish-speaking ELLs in both English and their native language.

AB  - This study tested the diverging predictions of recent theories of children's learning of spelling regularities. We asked younger (Grades 1 and 2) and older (Grades 3 and 4) elementary school–aged children to choose the correct endings for words that varied in their morphological structure. We tested the impacts of semantic frequency by including three types of words ending in -er: derived and inflected forms, the first of which are far more frequent across the language, and one-morpheme control forms. Both younger and older children were more likely to choose the correct ending for derived forms over one-morpheme control words. This difference emerged for inflected forms only for the older children. We also tested the impacts of orthographic frequency by contrasting performance on the two derived allomorphs -er and -or, the first of which is far more frequent, and comparison one-morpheme forms. Both younger and older children were more likely to choose the correct spelling for the derivational -er over the same letter pattern in control words. This difference did not emerge in either group for the -or ending. The implications of these findings for current models of children's spelling development are discussed.

AB  - A cognitive and a guidance dimension can describe the support of students' conceptual understanding in inquiry-based science education. The role of guidance for student learning has been intensively discussed. Furthermore, inquiry learning may pose particular challenges to students with low language proficiency. The present intervention in primary school (54 teachers, 1,070 students) aimed to examine the effects of additional guidance. Therefore, the control group uses a science unit mainly addressing the cognitive dimension of inquiry. In the 3 treatment groups, this unit was enriched with guidance through scaffolding instructional discourse, formative assessment, or peer-assisted learning. The results (43 teachers, 873 students) confirm that in each intervention condition, students' conceptual understanding significantly improves. In the formative assessment group, students' mean conceptual understanding is higher than in the control group. Moreover, formative assessment and scaffolding instructional discourse provided particular support to the conceptual understanding of students with poor language proficiency.

AB  - Formative peer assessment is an instructional method that offers many opportunities to foster students' learning with respect to both the domain of the core task and students' assessment skills. The contributions to this special issue effectively address earlier calls for more research into instructional scaffolds and the implementation of dialogic features in formative peer assessment. However, open issues remain regarding the role of assessment criteria, the benefit of formative peer assessment for transferable knowledge and skills, the role of metacognitive and cognitive processes in the provision and reception of peer feedback, and the proposed benefit of more interactive forms of formative peer assessment. Addressing the latter issue in particular, a framework of three dimensions of increasing interactivity is proposed in order to guide future research. These three dimensions comprise the learner's engagement with the core task (low interactivity), the provision and reception of peer feedback (medium interactivity), and the learner's engagement with argumentation, tutoring, and co-construction in dialogue with peers (high interactivity).

AB  - Performed an aptitude treatment interaction study on the differential effect of error correction (EC) as a function of cognitive and affective student characteristics. Ss were 35 Dutch-speaking high school seniors learning French as a 2nd language in 2 classes taught by 2 different female teachers. Over a 1-yr treatment period, 1 teacher made frequent ECs; the other avoided ECs as much as possible. 10 class periods were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed. Different tests were administered at the beginning and end of the school year. The hypotheses that EC does not lead to an across-the-board improvement of L2 achievement, and that EC interacts with individual differences were confirmed.

AB  - To investigate whether games may serve as useful formative assessment environments, this study examined, experimentally, the effects of two aspects of formative assessment on math achievement, game play, and help-seeking behaviors: (a) making assessment criteria explicit through the explanation of scoring rules and (b) incentivizing the use of feedback. A short pre-algebra game that targeted the concepts of adding rational numbers and the meaning of a fraction was used. Data were collected from 164 students in 4th to 6th grades at five after-school programs. Five treatment conditions were employed in the study. A control group played a different math game. Three variations of providing explanation of scoring rules were tested: (a) no scoring information; (b) feedback on when points were earned and lost; and (c) elaborated explanation of the scoring rules made available before the game was played (in the tutorials), as feedback during the game (math elaborated feedback provided after scored events), and in the general help menu. The fifth condition provided both the elaborated explanation of the scoring rules and also offered an incentive to access additional feedback by regaining a portion of points. An assessment that was administered as a pretest and posttest was used to measure math achievement. In-game performance data (e.g.. number of correct moves made in the game) were used to measure game performance. The proportion of times feedback was accessed was used to measure help seeking. Background information was also collected to obtain information on relevant variables such as prior math grades on report cards, game experience, and self-efficacy. Finally, students were administered a survey to measure their motivation to play the game. Findings indicate that although they accessed feedback less, students who were provided the combined treatment of the elaborated explanation of the scoring rules and offered the incentive to seek additional feedback had higher normalized gain scores (compared to students who received minimal scoring information). This treatment also resulted in better game performance. The combined treatment was more effective for students who reported low game experience, low self-efficacy, low math self-concept, and low preferences for cooperative learning, as well as male students, by increasing scores between pretest to posttest, yielding moderate to large effect sizes. Moreover, for students who reported receiving a "D" in math on their last report card and those with low self-efficacy, the combined treatment of explanation of scoring rules and incentive to seek additional feedback resulted in significantly higher posttest scores, with outcomes of these analyses also yielding large effect sizes. Both a significant interaction between treatment conditions and pretest scores and analyses of subsamples of students suggest that this combined treatment may promote deeper processing of the feedback for lower performing students, especially students with low academic intrinsic motivation. Overall, findings suggest that when designing games for learning, it is important to both make assessment criteria, (in this case, the scoring rules of a game) explicit to a student as well as to find ways to motivate students to use provided feedback through the use of incentives.

AB  - To investigate whether games may serve as useful formative assessment environments, this study examined, experimentally, the effects of two aspects of formative assessment on math achievement, game play, and help-seeking behaviors: (a) making assessment criteria explicit through the explanation of scoring rules and (b) incentivizing the use of feedback. A short pre-algebra game that targeted the concepts of adding rational numbers and the meaning of a fraction was used. Data were collected from 164 students in 4th to 6th grades at five after-school programs. Five treatment conditions were employed in the study. A control group played a different math game. Three variations of providing explanation of scoring rules were tested: (a) no scoring information; (b) feedback on when points were earned and lost; and (c) elaborated explanation of the scoring rules made available before the game was played (in the tutorials), as feedback during the game (math elaborated feedback provided after scored events), and in the general help menu. The fifth condition provided both the elaborated explanation of the scoring rules and also offered an incentive to access additional feedback by regaining a portion of points. An assessment that was administered as a pretest and posttest was used to measure math achievement. In-game performance data (e.g., number of correct moves made in the game) were used to measure game performance. The proportion of times feedback was accessed was used to measure help seeking. Background information was also collected to obtain information on relevant variables such as prior math grades on report cards, game experience, and self-efficacy. Finally, students were administered a survey to measure their motivation to play the game. Findings indicate that although they accessed feedback less, students who were provided the combined treatment of the elaborated explanation of the scoring rules and offered the incentive to seek additional feedback had higher normalized gain scores (compared to students who received minimal scoring information). This treatment also resulted in better game performance. The combined treatment was more effective for students who reported low game experience, low self-efficacy, low math self-concept, and low preferences for cooperative learning, as well as male students, by increasing scores between pretest to posttest, yielding moderate to large effect sizes. Moreover, for students who reported receiving a 'D' in math on their last report card and those with low self-efficacy, the combined treatment of explanation of scoring rules and incentive to seek additional feedback resulted in significantly higher posttest scores, with outcomes of these analyses also yielding large effect sizes. Both a significant interaction between treatment conditions and pretest scores and analyses of subsamples of students suggest that this combined treatment may promote deeper processing of the feedback for lower performing students, especially students with low academic intrinsic motivation. Overall, findings suggest that when designing games for learning, it is important to both make assessment criteria, (in this case, the scoring rules of a game) explicit to a student as well as to find ways to motivate students to use provided feedback through the use of incentives.

AB  - The quantitative study with a quasi-experimental design was conducted at a comprehensive high school to determine if a relationship could exist between the formative use of assessment and academic progress toward pre-determined learning objectives based on state standards. Academic progress toward learning objectives based on assessment results used formatively was compared to academic progress on assessment results used summatively. The sample population of convenience consisted of sophomore students from college-preparatory classes in world history. Formative assessment results from the experimental group were compared to assessment results used summatively from the control group. Teachers and students in the treatment group were provided specific feedback and assessment result analyses while participants in the control group were provided only assessment results. Statistical analyses of assessment results between assessment events and groups indicated that no statistically significant difference existed between the treatment and control groups. Limitations and implications derived from the study are discussed including the need to examine other aspects of the classroom environment that contribute to teaching and learning behaviors. Recommendations for further study on assessment data used formatively are presented.

AB  - Testing is the most common way to assess student learning at all ages and grade levels. Testing is traditionally viewed as a measure of knowledge, and not as a way to enhance learning. Nonetheless, a large body of literature demonstrates that testing is actually an effective way to facilitate learning and enhance long-term memory for information. This finding, that retrieval of information from memory leads to better retention than re-studying or re-reading the same information, has been termed the testing effect. The benefit of testing compared to review of material is typically seen after a delay between practice and final test, with review being a better strategy when the test is given immediately or after a short delay. This phenomenon has been shown across a variety of contexts, test formats, retention intervals, and ranges of ages and abilities. However, one domain in which the testing effect has not been shown to work is in the review of student-produced lecture notes. Lecture note-taking is a ubiquitous learning strategy and notes have been shown to be highly correlated with academic outcomes such as test performance and GPA. Note-taking in itself is a cognitively demanding process, and students often struggle to take accurate and complete notes from lecture, thus limiting the benefits of note-taking and review. There is limited research on ways to improve the review function of notes. Thus, this dissertation sought to understand the effect of integrating the testing effect into the context of lecture note-taking on memory for information compared to review of notes and a lecture-only control.A sample of 59 high school students watched a video lecture and took notes on the information. The lecture was divided into three sections with two-minute pauses in between each segment. During each pause, students were asked to either reread their notes from the previous section (review group), recall and write down what they remembered to be the most important ideas from the lecture they were just shown (self-testing group), or complete a distractor word search puzzle for the duration of the pause (lecture-only control group). Participants were given a written recall test of lecture information following a one-day delay. Comparisons were made between lecture groups on test performance and note quantity. Measures of sustained attention and mind-wandering during lecture were examined as covariates.While participants in the self-testing group scored higher on the written recall test, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Self-testing and reviewing notes during lecture pauses were both significantly better than lecture note-taking alone. Results also showed that it was actually the students in the review group who took significantly more notes than those in the lecture-only control. There was a main effect for time, indicating that students in all lecture groups took increasingly more notes as the lecture progressed. Note quantity was found to be a significant predictor of test performance. Examination of attentional variables showed that students who reported lower instances of mind-wandering took significantly more notes and did significantly better on the recall test. Further, students in the self-testing group reported less of an increase in mind-wandering as the lecture progressed compared to those in the control group.Differences between the results of this study and other studies in the testing effect literature are hypothesized to be due several factors, including complexity of lecture information, encoding difficulties, and the presentation of new information at each self-testing time point. Future research should continue to explore the testing effect in conjunction with note taking.

AB  - Students prepared for classroom examinations by completing practice tests, with selected items from these practice tests repeated, in either the original or in a modified wording, on classroom examinations and a final examination. The availability of immediate self-corrective feedback on Study 1 practice tests (0, 3, or 6 practice tests) was varied, while in Study 2, the timing of feedback provided during practice tests (immediate, end of test, 24-hour delay, control) was varied. Performance on examinations was elevated by the provision of immediate feedback on practice tests in both studies, especially when test items were presented in their original wording, with some generalization observed on items presented in a modified wording. Predictions made in accordance with the interference-perseveration hypothesis and the delayretention effect were not supported. These results demonstrate considerable potential for immediate self-corrective feedback, delivered during test preparation through the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique, to enhance performance on classroom examinations and to promote the retention of factual information during the academic semester.

AB  - The authors explored whether a testing effect occurs not only for retention of facts but also for application of principles and procedures. For that purpose, 38 high school students either repeatedly studied a text on probability calculations or studied the text, took a test on the content, restudied the text, and finally took the test a second time. Results show that testing not only leads to better retention of facts than restudying, but also to better application of acquired knowledge (i.e., principles and procedures) in high school statistics. In other words, testing seems not only to benefit fact retention, but also positively affects deeper learning.

AB  - The objective of this quasi-experimental quantitative study was to determine if the use of a student response system, combined with an interactive whiteboard, led to increased student achievement in mathematics within a fifth grade classroom as measured by a district benchmark assessment and the annual Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS) Test. The study was founded on the understanding that students in the United States were lagging further and further behind their international peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. One potential way to motivate students in these areas was to adhere to the constructivist approach to learning and to involve students in the construction of their own knowledge. Although very little research has been conducted combining interactive whiteboards and student response systems in elementary classrooms to measure their effectiveness related to student achievement, this combination may be what is needed to address how to raise student academic scores while engaging digital native students in the process. In this study, student scores from a district benchmark assessment served as the baseline measure of mathematical proficiency. The AIMS Test served as the outcome measure of mathematics achievement in the study. An analysis of covariance was conducted and it demonstrated a significant difference, based on a significance level of 0.05, between the treatment and the control groups, with F = 6.83 and p = 0.01. It was therefore determined that the use of a student response system positively affected student achievement in mathematics.

AB  - Considerable research has examined the use of rapid guessing measures to identify disengaged item responses. However, little is known about students who rapidly guess over the course of several tests. In this study, we use achievement test data from six administrations over three years to investigate whether rapid guessing is a stable trait-like behavior or if rapid guessing is determined mostly by situational variables. Additionally, we examine whether rapid guessing over the course of several tests is associated with certain psychological and background measures. We find that rapid guessing tends to be more state-like compared to academic achievement scores, which are fairly stable. Further, we show that repeated rapid guessing is strongly associated with students' academic self-efficacy and self-management scores. These findings have implications for detecting rapid guessing and intervening to reduce its effect on observed achievement test scores.

AB  - The importance of using systematic formative assessment to guide students toward meaningful learning has gained more recognition in the education community in recent years. This form of assessment is characterized by task-oriented feedback in a low-risk environment, which is believed to promote mastery goal orientation and self-regulated learning. In spite of these apparent benefits, formative assessment strategies are generally underutilized in the science disciplines. In this article, I describe an e-mail-based formative assessment program, which was established to encourage students to revisit first-year general chemistry material regularly in a low-risk and supportive environment. Because the aim was to foster a mastery goal orientation, no grades were assigned to students' responses, and participation in the program was optional. I describe the academic profile of students who participated regularly and their patterns of participation over the course of five years of implementation of this program.

AB  - • Learners' perceptions of test affected learning practices in different ways. • Learners' perceptions of test affected learning practices to varying degrees. • Learning practices positively and significantly affected learning outcomes. • Learning practices have differential effects on learning outcomes. • Effect size of learning practices on outcomes relates to participation frequency. The study aimed to explore the washback mechanism on learning by investigating the structural relationship between learners' perceptions of a test, learning practices, and learning outcomes via structural equation modeling. The participants in this study included 3105 Chinese senior high school students. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling were used in the analyses of the data. This study found that learners' perceptions of test validity, impact, and importance affected their learning practices in different ways and to different degrees. The research results also showed that four types of English learning practices had significant, positive, but differential effects on learning outcomes. The effect size was partly associated with the frequency of engagement with each learning practice. Based on the findings, some implications and suggestions were drawn for learners, teachers, test designers, and test authorities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - It's time to prepare teachers to take the plunge to teach in virtual worlds. Students are already there and their teachers need to follow. Unfortunately, teachers are often resistant to change their teaching practice, especially regarding the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) such as virtual worlds. The authors report on the experience of a cohort of pre-service teachers who transitioned from resistance to advocacy as a consequence of immersion in a curriculum-based virtual world. Curriculum-based interactive multi-user virtual worlds contribute to learning through transformational play combining learning, playing and helping. Learners make informed decisions whilst immersed in play. A recommended virtual world is Quest Atlantis; research-based and designed for learners aged nine to sixteen. Importantly, teachers need to be convinced that teaching objectives can be met in virtual worlds. Use of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledges (TPACK) framework can provide such evidence. Most Significant Change Stories gathered from pre-service teachers show the pre-service teachers transforming from resistance to advocacy. Findings indicated that once the pre-service teachers experienced transformational play they realised the value of the use of virtual worlds in teaching and that play can support learning and meet teaching objectives.

AB  - Effective teaching in the United States over the last decade has been based on student performance on standardized tests (Darling-Hammond, 2010). Many school districts, in attempts to make gains on standardized assessments, have implemented standardized formative assessment procedures that dictate intervention for students not making gains (Popham, 2011). It is my contention that in some cases, standardized formative assessment procedures have negated authentic formative assessments where teachers interpret any classroom activity, such as observation, teacher-student conversation, and teacher-student interaction, to adjust instruction to ensure that all students are making progress. I believe that there are two specific problems associated with standardized formative assessment: standardized formative assessments may not honor nor cultivate the teacher-student relationship inherent in transactional relationships (Ryan, 2011) and may not allow teachers flexibility of method to solve classroom-based problems in a practical way (Schwab, 1970). The purpose of this action research study was to describe the pedagogical strategies of an authentic formative assessment process my classroom. This study also explored how an authentic process can be a viable alternative to a standardized one within one classroom. Three major findings are present from the study: multiple strategies could be used to determine curricular needs for students; authentic formative assessments could honor and cultivate teacher-student relationships; classroom life was improved for me and my students when rigorous investigation into the assessment practices of the classroom were explored.

AB  - The testing effect is a phenomenon that may be described as follows: following the reading of a prose passage, a group of students who are given a posttest on the passage immediately or shortly afterward will later recall more of the passage on a retention test than will a similar group of students who are not given the posttest. Testing as a means of directly enhancing prose learning is generally not recognized and is not used much in the schools. If it were, every period of instruction would be brought to a close with a short test. Such a test could well be an ungraded self-test, for its purpose would be not to manage the instructional process, but to consolidate the learning experience that has just taken place. Testing in this sense is similar to practice or rehearsal. The testing effect consolidates learning in terms of degree of processing, not structurally. A test thus provides a stimulus for engaging in the consolidation of learning. The context here is similar to that of most adjunct aids, such as learning objectives, inserted questions, and typographical cueing, all of which suggest certain strategies to the learners. Research on the testing effect has generally excluded, for experimental reasons, the provisions of feedback, review opportunities, and test anticipation effects, in order to isolate the consolidation effect per se. However, all of these other factors would likely be present in educational contexts and would further add to the value of testing. (HOD)

AB  - Why is the teacher asking why? so much? Why is the teacher not calling on Mary and John, who have their hands up? And why is the teacher putting all answers on the white board, even the wrong ones? Students may struggle with such questions if they're unfamiliar with questioning techniques that seek to promote student learning, as opposed to just assess it. This article looks at seven moves teachers can make to improve their questioning techniques and become good formative assessors in the process. These include priming students first, posing good questions, pausing during questioning, probing student responses, bouncing questions through the classroom, using tagging to generate a wide range of responses, and using binning strategies.

AB  - Today, the importance of learning mathematics and reading by students in our schools has been underscored by the introduction of various high-stakes testing regimens in all states across the country. The requirements mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act (2002) necessitated a response to intervention that introduced many difficult challenges for school administrators. These requirements also are challenging the very organization of our nation's schools. These are especially important issues with regard to students who might be at risk of dropping out of school or falling behind their peers to the point where success becomes virtually impossible. They are the first generation immersed in technology since before they could walk; it is a fundamental part of their lives. These students crave the instant gratification that technology provides (Guthrie & Carlin, 2004). Fortunately, a number of tools such as electronic student response systems (SRS) have been developed in recent years that can help educators evaluate their students more efficiently in order to provide individualized instruction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether, in a regular 7th grade math class, there was a significant difference in the academic performance of students who used electronic response systems and those who did not. To achieve this purpose, the teacher selected two classes to use the student response systems and two classes that did not and compared their academic performance as well as Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) results. SRS provide students with the opportunity to actively participate in their learning environment. Student response systems are known variously as "clickers," audience response systems, and personal response systems. They were described by Skiba (2006) as being a new tool used by corporate America, Hollywood game shows, and many faculty that teach in large lecture halls. Simply put, these systems permit the instructor to use a computer with a projector to interact with students. The students use their clickers to make selections (Skiba, 2006). A growing body of research confirmed that the use of student response systems created an atmosphere of student interaction which enhanced critical thinking and the ability to utilize knowledge in the safety of the classroom environment. This form of technology helps the teacher direct or re-direct lessons depending on responses submitted by students (Caldwell, 2007). The participants in this study consisted of 97 regular 7th grade students who were enrolled in four different mathematics classes in the Columbia County School System in Evans, Georgia. The study determined whether there was a significant statistical difference in the academic performance of students who used electronic response systems compared to those who did not in these 7th grade mathematics classrooms. For this purpose, the teacher selected two classes that used student response systems and two classes that did not and compared academic performance and Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) results. Published CRCT results for the four 7 th grade classes for 2009 and 2010 were obtained and included in the data analysis. Four units were recorded for the four mathematics classes tested: (a) integers, (b) rational numbers, (c) linear equations, and (d) constructions. All four units have pre- and post- test scores. Two research questions were addressed in this study: 1. Did students perform better on mathematics assessments such as end-of-unit tests to a significant degree when they used student response systems? 2. Did the scores of the mathematics portion of the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) increase significantly for those students who were assessed in their regular mathematics instruction using student response systems? Data were amassed on 97 7th grade students as they were evaluated on teacher-made assessments, 4 units, and the mathematics portion of their Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT). A two-factorial repeated measures analysis of variance procedure was used to determine the difference of performance on the teacher and unit assessments. There was a significant difference in the pre- and post-unit test scores of students who used the student response systems when compared to those who did not. A one-factor analysis of variance procedure was used to determine if there was a significant difference in the CRCT scores of students who used the student response systems and those who did not. In addition, a simple t-test was used to analyze the difference of the CRCT scores of students who used the SRS and those who did not. There was a significant difference in the scores. The findings have implications for further research, particularly in the area of unit tests and the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test. It would be of interest to evaluate the benefits of the student response systems considering gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status.

AB  - This report presents elementary school test trend data for the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), Illinois for 2000 for the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS). In spring 2000, ITBS trend data show that mathematics test scores in the CPS elementary schools continue their long-term improvements for all age levels. Positive trends in ITBS reading scores continued for older students (aged 13 and 14), but the earlier rising trends for students aged 9 through 12 appear to have flattened out. Actual declines in reading test scores were apparent at some age levels (ages 9 and 12) in the grade equivalent metric. Productivity gains appear to have peaked in 1997 and have not improved since then. Unless a new cycle of productivity advance occurs, the flattening annual test score trends will probably continue. There was no evidence that the gap between racial/ethnic groups has narrowed or widened. There have been some changes in reporting and testing practices in the CPS; these are described. (SLD)

AB  - This study was conducted by the Central Region Educational Laboratory (REL Central) administered by Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning to provide educators and policymakers with rigorous evidence about the potential of Classroom Assessment for Student Learning (CASL) to improve student achievement. CASL is a widely used professional development program in classroom and formative assessment published by the Assessment Training Institute of Pearson Education. Schools were recruited from across Colorado to participate in the study. Colorado was chosen as the target state primarily because it has one of the largest populations in the Central Region from which to recruit schools and because its statewide achievement test is vertically scaled. This cluster randomized trial of the CASL professional development program had sufficient statistical power to detect an impact of at least 0.25 standard deviation on student achievement. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted to estimate the impact of CASL on student achievement; all schools were included in the analysis and were analyzed as randomized regardless of the level of implementation fidelity. Analysis did not reveal a statistically significant impact of CASL on the school-level average mathematics achievement of grade 4 and grade 5 students. Results from sensitivity analyses revealed that the impact estimates on student achievement were robust to decisions regarding the inclusion of covariates, estimation method, and the treatment of missing data. In other words, design and analysis decisions made by the research team did not change whether the impact results would have been statistically significant. Appendices include: (1) Power analysis; (2) Response rates by data collection wave, instrument, and experimental group; (3) Data collection instruments; (4) Development, reliability, and validity of teacher outcomes; (5) Teacher Assessment Work Sample; (6) Impact analysis models; (7) Calculation of effect sizes; (8) Treatment of missing data; (9) Variance components estimates and intraclass correlations; (10) Raw means and standard deviations; and (11) Complete mixed model results.

AB  - Outcomes on summative measures of achievement such as end-of-course assessments, which are often referred to as "high-stakes tests" because the results determine whether students have successfully met a graduation requirement, are likely the product of multiple factors. Students' aptitude, instructional practices and teacher attributes, characteristics of the assessment instrument, and other factors contribute to students' scores. Because only instructional factors are usually open to change by teachers, it should be valuable for teachers to have a trustworthy means of predicting students' outcomes as their knowledge and skill is forming during the course of instruction, thus permitting the teachers to make adjustments in instruction that will increase the chances of students passing the high-stakes test. One method of assessing students' competence formatively is to collect data during the course of study, and one of the most extensively studied systems for collecting such formative data is often referred to as "curriculum-based measurement" (CBM). Researchers who have examined the psychometric characteristics of CBM measures have found that CBM data collected during the course of study in the elementary areas of reading and arithmetic predict students' outcomes on norm-referenced and high-stakes tests Crawford, Tindal, & Steiber, 2001; Fewster & MacMillan, 2002; Helwig, Anderson, & Tindal, 2002; McGlinchey & Hixson, 2004; Sibley, Biwer, & Hesch, 2001). Although the technology exists for using CBM techniques in high-school content-area subject (sciences and social studies), no studies have examined whether these formative measures reliably predict students' outcomes on high-stakes tests. This study examined the relationship between scores on CBM measures, in the form of vocabulary-matching mini-tests and high-stakes summative assessments in social studies. Participants were three high school U.S. history teachers and their students. Students (total n=69) were in advanced placement (n=20) honors (n=27), and general level (n=22) classes. Thirty-nine students were female, and 30 were male. Independent variables included: (a) six researcher-developed CBM probes, or mini-quizzes, (b) a measure of general vocabulary, (c) class assignment, (d) class rank as determined by grades in the previous grading period, and (e) gender. Dependent variables were (a) a researcher-developed outcome measure based on Virginia's high-stakes assessment and (b) the Virginia high stakes Standards of Learning (SOL) test. The correlations between scores on CBM probes and both the researcher-made outcome measure (r=.327) and the Virginia SOL (r=.601) were statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Only class assignment and general vocabulary contributed to the prediction of students' scores on the mock outcome measure. However, for the actual high-stakes SOL assessment, class assignment, CBM score, and rank in the class contributed significantly to the prediction of outcomes. These findings indicate that formative assessment, in the form of CBM probes, is a good predictor of scores on high-stakes tests. This information can help teachers predict early in the semester which students are prepared and which students are not prepared for high-stakes tests. Given the capacity to predict outcomes, teachers can alter instruction and increase achievement.

AB  - Researchers have studied the relationship of student motivation, self-efficacy, and the use of formative assessments that might improve student learning. The local problem involved low standardized math test scores resulting in students not graduating, not qualifying for college, and having lower job readiness. The research question considered the effects of using a specialized formative assessment treatment to improve students’ motivation and perceived self-efficacy for learning math content. Self-efficacy and motivation theories provide the theoretical foundation for this study. This quasiexperimental, quantitative study considered the convenience sample of two intact classrooms of at-risk ninth grade students from a rural high school in the southeastern United States, who were at-risk for low academic performance in a course ( n = 35) over a 9-week period. The students’ pre and post data for perceived self-efficacy and motivation levels were measured using subscales questions from the Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scales Survey. The study used analysis of covariance to address the research question, accounting for possible extraneous variables. The results failed to reject the null hypothesis. However, the results may be used to design future action research to guide the leadership team for addressing the local problem of low standardized test math scores. Suggested recommendations may support positive social change by helping to improve the graduation rate, post secondary options, and job readiness of students, and the socioeconomic status of the rural community.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of frequent peer-monitored Fitnessgram testing, with student goal setting, on the PACER and push-up performance of middle school students. Subjects were 176 females and 189 males in 10 physical education classes at a middle school with an 83.7% Hispanic student population. Students were baseline fitness tested with five classes assigned to the control group and five to the experimental group with no significant differences between the two groups in baseline fitness test performance. Students in the experimental group set personal goals and participated in peer fitness testing four times over the next 18 weeks. Results from formal teacher testing at the end of 18 weeks using MANOVA demonstrated that placement in the experimental group had no effect on pre- versus posttest scores for PACER and push-up tests compared with the control group. Students in control and experimental groups also completed the PAQ-A, with results indicating a significant positive correlation of higher weekly activity levels with push-up scores, but no significant difference for weekly activity levels and PACER scores. Results are discussed in terms of Locke's goal setting theory as well as recent research pertaining to youth fitness testing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of curriculum- based measurement (CBM), with and without diagnostic feed- back, on general and special educators' instructional planning in reading. Participants were 19 second-grade teachers with their 309 students without disabilities and 16 resource teachers with their 127 first- through fifth-grade students with mild disabilities. Blocking on background (general vs. special education), teachers were assigned randomly to three conditions: control, CBM, or CBM with diagnostic feedback (CBM+D). CBM data were collected on students for 3 consecutive weeks. Then teachers attended a 2-hour workshop where they completed classwide and individual student instructional planning sheets in accordance with their experimental condition. For the individual plans, one high-, one average-, and one low-performing student was selected from each teacher's class. On the classwide plans, across backgrounds, teachers in the CBM+D condition targeted fewer objectives than control teachers. On individual plans, CBM+D resource teachers targeted appropriate skills for average- and low-achieving students more effectively than did CBM and control resource teach- ers, and CBM+D second-grade teachers targeted appropriate skills for average- and high-achieving target students more effectively than CBM second-grade teachers. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Examined the effects of combining curriculum-based measurement in mathematics computation with teachers' self-monitoring of instructional changes on academic progress of 33 elementary students (mean age 10.3 yrs) with learning disabilities and mild mental disabilities. 31 teachers (aged 30–39 yrs) were assigned to a control group that did not use curriculum-based measurement, a curriculum-based measurement-only group, or a curriculum-based measurement with self-monitoring group. In the curriculum-based measurement group, teachers assessed their students' progress by administering, graphing, and analyzing short, biweekly probes. Teachers in the curriculum-based measurement with self-monitoring group also used this monitoring system; in addition, they used a self-monitoring procedure that was structured to guide them in analyzing student progress and the instructional plan they had been using with an individual student. Results indicate that teachers who self-monitored their use of curriculum-based measurement revised their students' instructional plans in ways that differed significantly from those of teachers who did not self-monitor all parts of curriculum-based measurement. Additionally, the combination of curriculum-based measurement and self-monitoring resulted in significantly greater growth for students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The effects of repeated I.Q. testing were investigated to ascertain the necessity of constructing and using alternate test forms. There were also attempts made to describe selected individual characteristics of subjects who improved the most over the repeated testing. One hundred and forty-five students were tested at one month intervals for three months. Two forms of the Otis-Lennon Mental Abilities Test were used in a counter-balanced design. The total group improved only from the first to second testing session. Persons repeating the same form did significantly better than persons taking alternate forms over the same testing sessions. It appeared that the students did tend to remember items from testing session one to testing session two, but this trend did not hold into testing session three. In general, the mean scores tended to decrease from testing session two to testing session three. Persons who appeared to improve most were from the upper class, or girls, or had relatively high grade point averages. (Author)

AB  - An important recent finding is that testing improves learning and memory. In this article, the authors describe a demonstration that illustrates this principle and helps students incorporate more testing into their learning. The authors asked students to read one text using a Study–Study strategy and one text using a Study–Test strategy. One week later, the authors tested students’ memory for both texts with short-answer quizzes. The results revealed the standard testing effect and served as the basis for a laboratory report that required students to analyze and interpret the results and to answer questions about the testing effect and the experimental design. At the end of the term, students indicated that they were engaging in more testing during their studying.

AB  - Two biases can occur in multimedia learning: overconfidence and over-reliance on text processing. The present research sought to identify these biases and to investigate whether they can be reduced, and hence learning fostered, when studying and testing are repeated. In 2 experiments (Exp.1: N = 79, Exp.2: N = 52), students learned either with text only or with text and pictures (multimedia) about how the toilet flush works, gave judgments-of-learning (JOLs), were tested on the learning contents; afterwards this study-test cycle was repeated. Results from both experiments revealed stronger overconfidence due to multimedia in both study-test cycles (JOLs higher than learning outcomes). Eye movement data showed a relative increase in attention on the picture versus text from cycle 1 to cycle 2; this relative increase in attention was related to better learning outcomes. Repeated studying and testing thus helped to reduce over-reliance on text processing in multimedia learning, fostering performance.

AB  - Sixth grade students come to MS 331 with strong mathematics backgrounds from elementary school. Nevertheless, students often come with a dearth of skills when performing basic math computations. The focus of this study is to investigate the use of the 24 Game in quickening the ability of sixth graders to perform basic computations. The game reinforces skills along with strategy when finding correct solutions. Students practiced the 24 Game largely on homework assignments and to a lesser extent, during instructional time. Students were measured on their ability to compute arithmetic facts on one minute assessments. Each class showed positive growth as the rigor of the quizzes increased due to 24 Game exposure after three weeks. Students who practiced the 24 Game most frequently on their homework scored the highest. Non-participants on average scored lower than participants. The 24 Game creates cooperation, stamina, and excitement through problem-solving. The speed and accuracy of arithmetic skills for sixth grade students improved through the study period.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of commercially-available curriculum-based measurement instruments to monitor progress in the area of mathematics in terms of validity and sensitivity to growth when used with children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Participants included 43 students who were deaf in pre-kindergarten through sixth grade and six classroom teachers at a residential school for the deaf in a Southeastern state. Over a three-month period of time, curriculum-based measurement probes were administered in five mathematical skill areas. Through statistical analysis, the researcher determined quantitatively that significant growth occurred in four of the five mathematical skill areas. The study provided evidence that commercially-available curriculum-based measurements developed for hearing children were an effective progress monitoring tool for teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing when appropriate accommodations and testing conditions were employed. This study was limited in the ability to investigate the reliability of curriculum-based measurement due to the small sample size and time limitations. Further investigation within the population of students who are deaf and hard of hearing to establish a reliability factor related to curriculum-based measurement is warranted.

AB  - Given the importance of high-quality early literacy programs informed by ongoing and systematic assessment approaches for young English Language Learners (ELL) with disabilities, the study was designed to test the effectiveness of teachers using Curriculum-Based Decision Making (CBDM). In CBDM, teachers weekly assessed children's performance, made instructional adaptations based on the data, and evaluated the effects of instructional changes. CBDM was designed to enhance teachers' instructional planning and children's learning. Participants were 291 preschoolers and 17 teachers participating in an Early Reading First project where a validated, intensive, and structured early literacy program was being implemented. Teachers were assigned one of three groups: CBDM (CBM plus decision making guidelines), CBM-only, and no CBM (control). The number of children in each group was 53, 52, and 186 respectively. Children's progress in acquiring early literacy skills was evaluated using standardized measures of early literacy and class-wide applications of CBM. Results indicated significant group differences favoring the CBDM Group on posttests of early literacy measures. Both High- and Low-Risk Groups in the CBDM condition demonstrated significantly greater improvements on more posttests than groups in the CBM condition. In addition, both High- and Low-Risk Groups in the CBDM condition showed superior performance relative to the groups in the CBM condition even after pretest scores and language proficiency were controlled. As hypothesized, CBDM made a distinct contribution to the acquisition of early literacy skills of preschool ELL with and without special needs. Results support the systematic and structured evaluation of CBM data rather than unsystematic teacher inspection of CBM data for formulating decisions concerning the adequacy of instructional programs. The significant progress demonstrated by ELL with special needs and at-risk suggests that CBDM should be an integral component of preschool programs. Limitations and implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - This study employed regular classroom tests as an intervention to help students learn and understand the concepts periodicity and chemical bonds in chemistry. The participants of the study were thirty four second year science students at Swedru Senior High School in the Central Region of Ghana. These students were taught for eight weeks and at the end of each week made to take an essay-type test on the concepts they have learnt within the week and the previous weeks. Questions asked were constructed with increasing cognitive demand to challenge students to reason and apply the principles learnt in solving them. Descriptive feedback in the form of written comments was provided against any incorrect responses which did not reflect understanding of concepts learnt. These strategies adopted improved the performance of students in the weekly tests as most of the responses students provided in the weekly tests reflected understanding of the concepts learnt. The regular classroom tests made students revised their notes throughout the term and hence improved their performance in chemistry.

AB  - In recent years, some authors have been questioning evidences on positive effects of formative assessment in the classrooms practices and educational outcomes. They have remarked the need to do additional research on this topic. This work analyses the relationship between formative assessment in Secondary Education centres and the achievement attained. The sample has been constituted by 250 Andalusian centres, where 2,255 teachers have informed about their assessment practices. Results confirm a significant contribution to the achievement explanation coming from formative assessment. However, it is relatively low if compared to the effect of other variables, such as the socio-economical and cultural status of families. Furthermore, not every component in formative assessment plays the same role. Practices that imply the adoption of corrective measures are the more relevant. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] En los últimos años, algunos autores han cuestionado las evidencias recogidas sobre los efectos positivos que el uso de la evaluación formativa en las aulas tendría sobre las prácticas y resultados educativos, y han señalado la necesidad de realizar nuevos estudios. El presente trabajo analiza la relación entre la evaluación formativa practicada en los centros de educación secundaria y el rendimiento logrado. La muestra ha estado constituida por 250 centros andaluces, participando como fuente de datos un total de 2.255 profesores que informaron sobre las prácticas evaluadoras. Los resultados confirman una contribución significativa de la evaluación formativa a la explicación del rendimiento, aunque relativamente baja si se compara con el efecto de otras variables, como es el caso del nivel socioeconómico y cultural de las familias. Además, no todos los componentes de la evaluación formativa juegan el mismo papel, destacando aquellas actuaciones que implican la adopción de medidas correctoras.

AB  - Providing formative assessment opportunities has been recognised as a significant benefit to student learning. The outcome of any formative assessment should be one that ultimately helps improve student learning through familiarising students with the levels of learning required, informing them about gaps in their learning and providing feedback to guide the direction of learning. This article provides an example of how formative assessments can be developed into a formative assessment journey where a number of different assessments can be offered to students during the course of a module of teaching, thus utilising a spaced-education approach. As well as incorporating the specific drivers of formative assessment, we demonstrate how approaches deemed to be stimulating, interactive and entertaining with the aim of maximising enthusiasm and engagement can be incorporated. We provide an example of a mixed approach to evaluating elements of the assessment journey that focuses student reaction, appraisal of qualitative and quantitative feedback from student questionnaires, focus group analysis and teacher observations. Whilst it is not possible to determine a quantifiable effect of the assessment journey on student learning, usage data and student feedback shows that formative assessment can achieve high engagement and positive response to different assessments. Those assessments incorporating an active learning element and a quiz-based approach appear to be particularly popular. A spaced-education format encourages a building block approach to learning that is continuous in nature rather than focussed on an intense period of study prior to summative examinations.

AB  - New Hampshire's Performance Assessment of Competency Education (PACE) pilot received a waiver from federal statutory requirements related to state annual achievement testing starting in the 2014-15 school year. PACE is considered an "innovative" assessment and accountability system because performance assessments are used to help determine student proficiency in most federally required grades and subjects instead of the state achievement test. One key criterion for success in the early years of the PACE innovative assessment system is "no harm" on the statewide accountability test. This descriptive study examines the effect of PACE on Grades 8 and 11 mathematics and English language arts student achievement during the first three years of implementation (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 school years) and the extent to which those effects vary for certain student subgroups using results from the state's accountability tests (Smarter Balanced and SATs). Findings suggest that students in PACE schools tend to exhibit small positive effects on the Grades 8 and 11 state achievement tests in both subjects in comparison to students attending non-PACE comparison schools. Lower achieving students tended to exhibit small positive differential effects, whereas male students tended to exhibit small negative differential effects. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.

AB  - There is a need to identify educational tools and methods that are easily assimilated into a secondary science education classroom. The use of testing as an educational tool, rather than as a summative assessment only, has emerged as a possible solution. Test-enhanced learning is attributed to the testing effect (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). The testing effect refers to the higher probability of recalling an item resulting from the act of retrieving the item from memory (testing) versus additional study trials of the item (Craney et al., 2008). A comparison of frequent testing/quizzing versus no quizzing outcomes were studied to determine whether the testing effect has a positive influence on learning gains in a high school science setting. Eighty-eight juniors and seniors enrolled in chemistry (4 sections) and advance placement biology (1 section) classes during the 2012-2013 school year were studied. A within student experimental design was used. Students were pre-tested prior to content coverage. Upon completion of each topic section the students were given quizzes with feedback. The quizzes targeted 50% of the pre-test/post-test material but were not identical in wording. Learning gains for the quizzed material were equivalent to the learning gains for the non-quizzed material in 66% of the instances tested. In 44 % of the individual classes the learning gains were greater for the quizzed condition. For these pooled data, quizzing resulted in greater learning gains in all chapters. For two of the three biology chapters quizzing resulted in greater learning gains. These results indicate that using tests and quizzes as an educational tool can have a positive impact on student learning gains.

AB  - The participants in this study were high school Hispanic students from four geometry classes. All students were taught by the same teacher, and the duration of the experiment was for one term or six weeks. Two classes were placed in the control group and another two classes in the experimental group. In the control group, students took weekly quizzes every Friday, and in the experimental group, students took daily short quizzes during the last 10 minutes of the class. The investigator examined whether the daily quizzes had a significant impact on student mathematics achievement as measured by the final exam. The researcher also examined whether daily quizzing had any effect on students' homework grades. The study found that daily quizzing significantly improved student mathematics scores and homework grades.

AB  - In this study a randomized experimental design was used to examine the effects of a digital formative assessment tool on mathematics achievement and motivation in grade three primary education (n schools = 79, n students = 1808). Experimental schools used a digital formative assessment tool whereas control schools used their regular teaching methods and materials. The tool provides student feedback, feedback to teachers, and adaptive assignments. Data included standardized achievement pre-posttest data, student motivation survey data, classroom observation data, and student log files. Multilevel analysis revealed positive effects on student achievement and motivation. Students’ intensity of use measurements support the effects found on student achievement and motivation. Furthermore, achievement effects were higher for high-performing students.

AB  - Investigated whether students who receive formative testing (a teaching and learning approach) and those who do not can be affectively distinguished. 233 secondary school students participated in a nonrandomized, control group, pretest–posttest design. Seven instruments were constructed and validated for data collection. Ss under formative testing could be distinguished from nonformative treatment Ss, using a combination of affective and cognitive variables. Formative testing appeared useful for diagnostic purposes.

AB  - Language in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) allows the use of response-to-intervention (RTI) methodology in the identification of specific learning disabilities. However, there is no consensus on decision rules using curriculum-based measurement of oral reading fluency (CBM-R) for defining responsiveness. The purpose of this article is to describe how to apply generalizability (G) theory for making quantitative high-stakes RTI decisions. A sample of 68 first-grade students (36 females and 32 males) was randomly administered the first-grade Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills oral reading fluency probes and correct words per minute (CWPM) were calculated for conducting both a generalizability (G) study and a decision (D) study using G theory. The results showed that the average raw scores (CWPM) across 20 probes encompassed a wide range from a low of 69 CWPM to a high of 88 CWPM. In addition, 90.2% of the variance was due to student reading skill, 7.0% was due to unaccounted sources of error, and only 2.8% was due to passage or probe variability. Also, the increasing number of probes administered (from 1 to 9) considerably reduced the values of standard error of measurement and increased the reliability coefficients. An example is provided to demonstrate how to apply G theory in using CBM-R data to guide psychometrically valid RTI decisions at the individual student level.

AB  - Current trends in mathematics instruction delivery methods show an increase in the integration of face-to-face instruction with online course management systems (OCMA) and paper-and-pencil methods as learning media. The evidence on the impact of OCMA use on students' mathematics performance, satisfaction, and achievement is inconclusive. The focus of this quasi-experimental two-group comparison quantitative research was to investigate if there is a difference in mathematics performance, satisfaction, and achievement between middle school students using OCMA and those of their peers who used paper-and-pencil methods. Fifty-seven 6th grade students from a medium-size urban middle school located in the southern region of the United States took part in this study. A pretest, posttest, and satisfaction questionnaire were administered in print format and students' responses were completed using paper-and-pencil methods. The treatment consisted of four weekly mathematics assessments administered via OCMA and reflecting concurrent mathematics content instruction. The responses to these assessments provided the data for statistical analysis using ANCOVA to control for students' mathematics ability. The results showed that there is statistically significant evidence that the use of OCMA in 6 th grade mathematics increased students' performance, there is statistically significant evidence that the use of OCMA in 6th grade mathematics increased students' satisfaction, and that there is no statistically significant evidence that the use of OCMA in 6th mathematics increased students' achievement. Research is needed to elucidate the effects of OCMA use on mathematics achievement as OCMA use was identified as an influential but not statistically significant factor in explaining mathematics achievement. Further research on the impact of OCMA use in K-12 mathematics education on students' performance, satisfaction, and achievement is needed to clarify inconsistent evidence found in the literature. Research on the effects of OCMA use in K-12 mathematics education on students' conceptual understanding, skills mastery, and content retention is needed as relatively few studies have been conducted in these areas.

AB  - The present study investigated the impact of an integrated learning system (ILS) on student performance. Specifically, the WICAT ILS was evaluated through traditional and curriculum-based procedures. Students (N = 600) from a suburban southwestern school district participated in the study. Students were administered a pre-test in reading and mathematics through the WICAT system. Students received WICAT instruction three times per week in 45 minute sessions for seven weeks at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the seven week period, students received a post-test in reading and mathematics presented on the WICAT system. Student performance was examined with regard to sex, grade, socioeconomic status, academic subject, and educational program. Using a ANCOVA, significant differences were identified across grade, SES, and type of educational program. First and fourth grade students performed significantly higher on the post-test than second, third, and seventh graders. Significant grade differences were also demonstrated in slope of daily WICAT mastery tests. Students who were from lower SES backgrounds mastered more skills on the post-test than students from higher SES backgrounds. Similarly, students receiving special education services obtained higher post-test percentages than regular education students. Implications were discussed in terms of educational importance and future research.

AB  - Describes the Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring (CAM) program which has been in effect in Hopkins, a Minneapolis suburb, since 1970. CAM tests are given regularly and frequently, with each test graded and returned to the classroom within a day or two. Much teacher time is saved and the students can see where they stand while the course is in progress. (MF)

AB  - Interteaching has shown to be an effective alternative to traditional lecture in a number of studies, but thorough analyses of its components, including frequent exams, is limited. Research suggests that increasing the frequency of exams may improve student learning. This study assessed the effectiveness of interteaching's frequent exams component on student exam scores in two introductory psychology course sections at a community college. Six unit exams were given to Section 1 and 12 to Section 2. Both sections received identical pretests and posttests. Although statistically insignificant, Section 2 consistently scored better or equal to Section 1 on all exams. Section 2 also produced a greater difference between pretest and posttest scores. Although not reaching traditionally significant levels, the results suggest that students given frequent exams may achieve higher exam scores and increase retention of overall course material.

AB  - For generations—and certainly for the last 30 years—proponents of traditional and progressive philosophies have argued over how best to educate our children. Although this debate is often carried out in the political and academic spheres, the difficulties created by not being able to resolve the differences between the two belief systems become blatantly clear in the pedagogy of early literacy. On the one hand, traditionalists argue for a direct and explicit instructional methodology, and on the other hand, progressives advocate for Whole Language or Balanced Literacy instruction. The classroom often becomes a battlefield as advocates of these opposing schooling paradigms struggle with each other. Differences emerge about which skills and what knowledge are the most important for students to master. Conflicts arise over which methodology is most effective in ensuring that students gain access to bodies of knowledge. The result is that the real world of classroom instruction often becomes a mish-mash of content and strategies that derive from both philosophies. Student assessments frequently contribute to the confusion because they are not aligned with the knowledge and skills students are expected to acquire as well as with the strategies teachers use. Without assessments that are tightly coupled with the underlying philosophy of an instructional program, with classroom practice, and with high-stakes summative assessments, it is extremely difficult for both teachers and administrators to have confidence that they are offering their students the best possible learning opportunities. Interim/benchmark assessments are vital tools for linking classroom instruction with year-end assessments and an essential element of any comprehensive assessment system. Currently, the Dynamic Indicator of Beginning Early Literacy Skills, commonly referred to as DIBELS, is a widely used interim/benchmark assessment. It serves many districts and schools quite well. However, many progressive educators believe that the DIBELS assessment is not well-aligned with a Balanced Literacy approach. In this dissertation the author examines the following essential question about early literacy interim/benchmark assessments: (a) Is the relationship between the assessed level on the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA), which fits within a Balanced Literacy framework, and student’s performance on high stakes accountability test as strong as the relationship of DIBELS to these same tests; and (b) does the DRA have a degree of predictive validity comparable to DIBELS? The study demonstrated a strong relationship between the DRA and performance on OAKS and that the DRA has a degree of predictive validity that is comparable to DIBELS. The results from the study support the claim that a curriculum-based measure, such as the DRA, can be used as a literacy screening assessment to detect potential reading difficulties. These results give support to progressive educators who wish to have a viable alternative DIBELS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Within the last decade, reports have indicated that the number of students classified as learning disabled (LD) has increased by 119%. Issues and research relating to this increment such as problems with assessment practices, special education decision-making practices, and the demands made by the regular education curriculum are reviewed. Research in both special and regular education has pointed directly or indirectly to curriculum-based assessment (CBA) and collaboration between the two systems as effective alternatives for assisting students with learning problems. However, barriers to implementation (e.g., personnel resistance) have been observed in schools implementing these alternatives. In order to develop grassroots support, a contextually appropriate model, Curriculum-Oriented Remediation/Prevention System (CORPS) was designed to ease the implementation and administration of CBA via problem-solving teams and consultation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects an "instructional package", designed to train inservice school personnel in components of CORPS, had on the behavior of personnel and students referred for reading problems. Social validation (satisfaction ratings) of personnel and students with CORPS and procedures used to implement CORPS were also examined. Twenty implementors (school psychologists; special, regular, and Chapter 1 educators) accurately and reliably implemented CORPS for 30 elementary students. Results. The repeated measures ANOVA used to evaluate the changes in classroom behavior (pre-postobservations) was inconclusive due to the small sample size and the variability of behaviors resulting from different instructional arrangements in reading. However, while not statistically significant, the desired trend was observed in the amount of time students were actively engaged in academic tasks. Results from supplemental reading data indicated that 90% of the students demonstrated progress in reading. Satisfaction data suggested that personnel were quite positive about the effectiveness of CORPS and procedures used to implement CORPS. Student responses to satisfaction questionnaires were also positive. Discussion. Results are discussed regarding the overall effectiveness of the CORPS program and satisfaction of school personnel and students regarding the effectiveness and acceptability of CBA as implemented within the CORPS model. Limitations of the study and the need for future research are delineated.

AB  - A study of the effectiveness of formative evaluation and remediation activities in achievement of intellectual skills was made, involving a general science teacher and his four classes of 90 eighth grade students. Subjects were ranked by using the Arithmetic Skill Test of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and randomly assigned into three treatment groups. Each group was further divided into seven levels of the classification variable. All subjects were first presented a tape-slide instructional program and then took a diagnostic test. The remedial activity materials were delivered in the following day. Group 1 received an alternative form of instruction designed to teach similar objectives, while group 2 received additional practice items. No additional instruction was given to group 3. A 13-item measuring instrument was used. Analyses showed that, in remediation of learning errors, the alternative form of instruction was proved more effective than the use of additional practice items, agreeing with Gagne's hypothesis. Group 1 and group 2 achieved better than did group 3. Diagnostic tests were proved important in the production of higher student performance. Implications for classroom teachers and curriculum designers are provided. (CC)

AB  - Sound classroom assessment requires meaningful grades. Yet often grades are impossible to interpret. Traditional assessment and grading practices can leave students unclear about what skills they need to improve on and lack detail. Further, compounding these issues is that often students cannot attempt to improve the skills. Often teachers teach to a topic instead of an ability to be honed. At Jeff Tech, we have seen the power of teaching a skill, providing feedback, and allowing a student to show mastery in Career and Technical (CTE) classrooms. Students internalize expectations that they can and will be able to master the necessary skills and demonstrate that mastery. Curriculum in all areas is broken into a set of skills. Students are assessed using formative and summative means on each skill and attempt a skill multiple times with a variety of assessments and differentiation. The goal is for a student to master a task, not simply to assign a number value to their attempt or to assess what they are capable of in the moment. This study examined the effectiveness of the school-wide competency based grading platform at Jeff Tech. Student performance on the Keystone Exams in Mathematics were evaluated for growth. The Algebra 1 classes were evaluated for the final grades of students and the passing rates. Data aided in determining the success of the program. The implications in this study can be used to determine the level of ongoing commitment that each stakeholder should have towards the initiative.

AB  - Two forms of assessment, summative and formative, are the primary means by which teachers determine student progress and achievement. Summative assessments help teachers determine what students have learned at the end of a unit of instruction. They are often used to help teachers determine whether their instruction was effective or to grade students. Unlike summative assessments, formative assessments are primarily used to inform teachers about what students know before a unit of instruction or what they are learning as a unit progresses. They are critical for informing teachers and students of their progress toward achieving the national standards, and they need to be an integral component of the instructional process in today's schools. This article informs teachers about formative assessment and provides examples of how K-12 teachers can integrate PE Metrics into instruction in order to determine progress toward student learning.

AB  - The achievement of two large classes of students in a course in Government was used to determine the benefits to learning gained when (a) short quizzes for the purpose of guiding the student's own achievement were given, and (b) voluntary discussion groups were provided for both classes each week in addition to the three regular class periods. The control group consisted of 97 students to whom only the regular monthly quizz was given and the experimental group consisted of the other class of 198 students to whom the weekly quizz was administered in addition to the regular monthly quizz. The criterion variable for evaluating the experimental results is based on the grades assigned as a result of five one-hour tests. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Weekly quizzes, which were marked but which did not contribute to the students' grades, were given to one section of 198 students in a lecture course in Government. A control section of 97 students received instruction and opportunities for discussion similar to those of the experimental group, but did not take weekly quizzes. The records of all 91 eligible cases from the control section and from a random sample of 91 cases from the experimental group were analysed. The frequently quizzed students attended more voluntary discussion groups, and showed significantly higher achievement even after the profits from such attendance were accounted for. The effect of the weekly quizzes appears to be increased motivation, resulting in greater effort and in superior achievement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As public schools across the country strive to meet the proficiency goals of No Child Left Behind, there is an increased interest in integrating knowledge and use of formative assessment as a method to raise student achievement. Since measures for Adequate Yearly Progress focus on language arts and mathematics, science curriculum may not receive the same emphasis when administrators and teachers plan school improvement to align standards-based curriculum and assessment. Yet embedded in science curriculum are inquiry approaches and assessment opportunities critical to increasing student achievement in all areas of curriculum. The intent of the study is to identify key factors of formative assessment missing from teacher practice and develop a model of effective practice to build assessment literacy. A case study approach was used to analyze research-based theory of formative assessment in a K-3 elementary school science program. To increase knowledge, the case study needed to include a model for professional development. To increase use, the model needed to be accessible, sensitive to curriculum and instruction, standards-based, and provide data for timely feedback for teacher and student interaction to promote student learning. This paper includes a literature review of theory and research of formative assessment used to design the model. Data was collected employing a mixed-method approach that used surveys, student work, and document reviews with direct observations and teacher interviews to triangulate evidence of teacher beliefs, dispositions and classroom practice of the participants. While the findings cannot be generalized because of statistically insignificant numbers in the study, there is useful evidence to consider when integrating formative assessment and classroom practice. The significant findings of this case study are: (1) Teachers cling to deeply held pedagogical beliefs of assessment as a tool for teacher use and accountability rather than as a method to involve students in a constructivist assessment environment. (2) Teachers do not feel the same accountability for science content standards as they do for standards in reading, writing, and math. (3) Student achievement is more favorably influenced by a balance of assessment methods. Frequency of use of assessment is not as significant to student performance as is the type of assessment selected. Increased student involvement with learning criteria and the formative assessment suggests improved performance on summative assessments. (4) Individual teacher competencies increase in a collaborative professional community and influence use of formative assessment practice. A case study of formative assessment is likely to show variations among staff with the fidelity of implementation. Continued practice, ongoing professional development and collaborative opportunity will improve knowledge and use of effective formative assessment practices.

AB  - Students' thinking should serve as the foundation of effective science curriculum and instruction. To promote science learning, particularly in the geosciences, teachers must attend to students' existing ideas about natural phenomena through the use of ''high-leverage'' instructional practices such as formative assessment. Elementary teachers need support to learn to implement formative assessment practices effectively. However, few studies have explored relationships between elementary teachers' content knowledge and formative assessment practices, analysis of students' thinking, and instructional decision making. To begin to address this gap in the literature, we conducted a convergent parallel mixed methods study to examine how elementary teachers employ formative assessment practices to scaffold elementary students' learning about interactions between water and the geosphere, which is a core, unifying concept in the Earth sciences. This research is embedded within a multiyear professional development program designed to support elementary teachers (grades 3-5) to learn to employ formative assessment in their classrooms. Study findings show teachers' own knowledge of geoscience disciplinary content is unrelated to their formative assessment practices. They also highlight the importance of the elementary science curriculum materials teachers use in framing disciplinary concepts in ways that influence how teachers evaluate student artifacts and engage in follow-up instruction based.

AB  - A computerized monitoring system was developed for grades 4-6. Objectives and corresponding test items were stored on computer. Instructors selected objectives for each monitoring period. Stdents were tested frequently using interchangeable forms of tests covering these objectives. Tests were computer scored and interpreted by teachers. These interpretations led to curriculum decisions as well as student feedback. After the system was implemented, student performance on both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced tests improved.

AB  - An interest in conditions of practice and feedback led to a study which examined the effect on writing by elementary school students of (1) two types of practice, both similar to "free focused writing"; (2) practice at a frequency greater than once a week; and (3) a procedure by which students measured their own performance and provided themselves with feedback. Subjects were 130 second, third, and fourth grade students from six schools, along with six teachers. Both treatment groups wrote for 15 minutes, three times a week, for 10 weeks and completed 5 pretreatment and 5 posttreatment exercises (which took two weeks), for a total of 12 weeks of writing. After each exercise, students counted the number of words they had written (regardless of errors) and recorded the total on a graph; the count was considered self-provided feedback as there was no teacher or peer feedback. There were no restrictions or suggestions on mode of writing, but students were given a sequence of general subjects and were permitted to move to another subject after writing on one. Results showed significant gains in both treatment groups, for groups of boys and girls, and for different grade levels in fluency, spelling, and other matters of correctness in wording. Significant gains were also found in some but not all aspects of sentence complexity and no differences were found between groups provided verbal and visual stimuli. (HOD)

AB  - Two techniques can be used to improve spelling scores and make spelling more interesting. The first technique is a combination of peer tutoring and the corrected-test technique. Students are paired as tutors and tutees on the basis of past spelling performance. The tutor gives a series of bi-weekly spelling tests to the tutee and helps with error correction. Research on this technique showed that all members of the class spelled more words correctly after peer tutoring than before, tutees made greater gains than their tutors, and attitudes about spelling became more positive. The second technique involves dividing the class into small groups which complete spelling exercises together. If the group is successful, members are rewarded with 15 minutes of free time; if all members of the group are not successful in scoring at least 80% on the test, they spend the 15 minutes reviewing the spelling words. This cooperative approach resulted in higher class achievement for the low spelling achievers and suggested that the better students also benefitted significantly. Both techniques utilize the positive aspects of more individualized instruction and increase student involvement. (One figure is included.) (MG)

AB  - In an "ex post facto" causal-comparative research design, this study investigated the effectiveness of a formative writing assessment program, Write Score, on increasing student writing achievement. Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) reading language arts and writing scores from 2012 were utilized for this study. The independent variable in this study was the formative assessment intervention, Write Score. The dependent variables in this study were TCAP Reading Language Arts scale scores and TCAP Writing holistic scores. Data were collected over the course of the 2011-2012 school year and involved 188 eighth grade students from two schools in the Upper Cumberland Region of Middle Tennessee. The experimental group, who received Write Score, was referred to as School A, and the control group who received traditional writing instruction without the Write Score formative assessment, as School B. Both groups received traditional writing instruction programs embedded in the reading and language arts program. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and stepwise test of multiple regression were used to check the main effects of each variable. The covariates used in these analyses were TCAP Grade 5 Writing scores and TCAP Reading Language Arts Scale Scores. The ANCOVAs did not reveal a statistically significant difference between School A, those who received the Write Score intervention, and School B, the control. At a 95% confidence level, the stepwise method noted that 67% of the variance in the 2012 TCAP Writing assessment for School A was accounted for by the TVAAS proficiency score and that 72% of the variance in the 2012 TCAP writing score was accounted for by the Grade 5 reading language arts score and TVAAS proficiency score together. It was concluded that while differences between the Write Score formative assessment and student TCAP achievement were observed, no statistically significant main effect was found. Conclusions noted the need for educators to use rubrics and monitoring instruments to help eliminate variability. From this study, it is recommended that practitioners increase time for students to write across the curriculum incorporating content rich text, and incorporate a combination of technology and human holistic scoring to increase specific formative feedback.

AB  - Students involved in holistic technological practice need to develop an understanding of technological practice outside the classroom and to participate in tasks set as close as practicable to actual technological practice. This paper investigates the context of assessment and its relationship to achievement and the importance of teacher knowledge to student technological practice. I argue that ‘out of context’ assessment tasks do not give an accurate indication of achievement levels of the children assessed. Introduced is the Model of Student Technological Practice, which identifies four constraints that influence student technological practice. A significant factor is teacher knowledge, as it impacts greatly on the quality of feedback given to students by their teachers. Timely teacher intervention and formative assessment feedback will alter student technological practice and should improve the students’ likelihood of developing successful outcomes.

AB  - Evaluated 4 procedures designed to help 29 poor spellers from Grades 4–8 improve their achievement on weekly tests: (a) a pretest over the week's spelling words followed in 2 days by the regular weekly test; (b) a positive practice procedure in which Ss were required to correct any misspelled word on the weekly test by writing out its correct spelling, part of speech, phonetic spelling, complete definition, and correct usage in 5 different sentences; (c) a pretest, positive practice of the pretest, and the weekly test; and (d) a pretest, positive practice of the pretest, weekly test, and positive practice of the weekly test. The pretest/positive practice/test/positive practice procedure was the most effective, producing a 14% increase in spelling achievement. The pretest/positive practice/test (11% increase) and positive practice (10% increase) procedures were of near equal effectiveness. The pretest procedure produced no increase.

AB  - Standardised tests help measure student's progress at school and can inform education policy about existing shortfalls. However, too much testing could lead to much pressure on students and teachers to learn and teach for a test, something that would take the joy out of the learning process. Many parents and educators are all too familiar with this quandary: they recognise that good measurement can drive improvement, but often argue that too much testing can make students anxious without improving their learning. In particular, standardised tests that determine the academic and life pathways of students may trigger anxiety, and if conducted too frequently might lead to poorer performance, absenteeism and lower self-confidence. But are standardised tests really used all that frequently? And what do PISA data show about the relationship between performance, anxiety and the frequency of testing?

AB  - The current study was designed to demonstrate how researchers could use a direct measure of functional reading skills (e.g., rates of silent reading comprehension) to empirically validate the effectiveness of a repeated readings intervention. A multi-element design was used to compare the effects of the treatment with a control condition across 3 secondary students (12-, 13-, and 16-yr-old males) diagnosed with specific learning disabilities in reading. Results show that repeated readings increased factual comprehension levels and factual reading comprehension rates. No differences were found across conditions on inferential comprehension levels or rates. Empirically validating reading interventions using rates of silent reading comprehension and theoretical implications related to enhancing inferential and literal comprehension and fluency are discussed.

AB  - If tests of cognitive ability are repeatedly taken, test scores rise. Such retest effects have been observed for a long time and for a variety of tasks. This study investigates retest effects on figural matrix items in an educational context. A short term effect is assumed for the direct retest administration in the same test session, and a long term effect is assumed for a retest interval of six months. Using multilevel modeling, we analyze if the magnitude of these effects is not only influenced by individual variation, but also by the cluster structure of students grouped within classrooms. We also investigate if the use of identical versus parallel tests has an impact on the size of the retest effects. Our main results show a negligible short term retest effect, but a large long term retest effect. Using parallel tests does not contribute to understanding individual differences in retest effects. The variation in retest effects is larger between classrooms than between students. Reasoning ability, as measured with a different test, and school grades significantly influences retest effects at the individual level, but at the classroom level, only reasoning ability is a significant predictor.

AB  - Students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) in mathematics can typically experience long-lasting problems when developing fluency with basic math facts despite the use of evidence-based practices. One recently developed intervention to promote memorization and fact-fluency is Mastering Math Facts (MMF). MMF is a commercially-available program that is in use in schools across the United States, yet there is currently limited empirical evidence that shows its impact as an intervention for students with SLD. The current study investigated the effectiveness of MMF for four second- and third-grade students with SLD in mathematics by measuring digits correct per minute (dc/m) and per 2 minutes (dc/2m) on daily curriculum-based measures and weekly 2-minute math facts timings, respectively. Improvements were noted across all students' dc/m and dc/2m scores from their pre-test and baseline measures following implementation of MMF. Implications for educators are provided.

AB  - Although spelling skill progress has typically been studied within the context of students' responses to written story starters (Deno, Marsten, & Mirkin, 1982; Fuchs & Fuchs, 2011; Hosp, Hosp, & Howell, 2007; Shinn & Shinn, 2002), there has been little research conducted within a curriculum-based measurement framework that has studied spelling progress monitoring on a weekly basis throughout an entire school year. The authors evaluated spelling progress using word triads, defined as a group of 3 words (with the same number of letters) that have a similar phonetic or morphological structure. Successful spelling of word triads as the unit of analysis has the potential to be more useful diagnostically to teachers than successful spelling of single words as the unit of analysis. An alternating series of three 15-word spelling tests were administered weekly to 10 third- and fourth-grade classrooms in the same school district throughout the school year for 8 rounds (1 round = 3 weeks of different but phonetically and/or morphologically similar word lists). Results indicate steady progress throughout the school year in the correct spelling of word triads (despite teacher reporting of no explicit spelling instruction in classrooms using in the words employed in the study). Correlations between the number of correctly spelled word triads with standard scores from a group-administered communication arts test were significant and comparable to alternate spelling test scoring methods. The authors conclude with limitations of the study and implications for practitioners.

AB  - Three related studies were conducted to examine the effects of variations in procedures used for curriculum-based assessment of reading proficiency: the first addressed the question of the influence of sample duration on the concurrent validity of the measure; the second addressed the question of the influence of sample duration on the level, slope, and variability of performance over repeated measurements; and the third examined the effect that varying the size of the pool from which items are drawn has on slope and variability of performance on the measure. Results of the studies provided evidence that sample duration is an important consideration in curriculum-based measurement because of its probable impact on variability and slope. Increasing sample duration from 30 seconds to a three minute sample reduced day-to-day variability in performance and resulted in a more rapid increase in student performance. The results with respect to sampling from domains of differing sizes indicated that measurement samples drawn from smaller domains are more sensitive to variations in instruction, but somewhat more variable. The optimum daily measurement procedure would seem to involve sampling from a pool of stimulus items well beyond that defined by the short-term objectives, but not in excess of an annual goal.

AB  - In special education, a merger between assessment and instruction is mandated by Federal law (PL 94-142), wherein teachers of handicapped pupils are required to specify individualized educational programs that include procedures for assessing students' progress toward goal attainment. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of technically adequate, repeated curriculum-based measurement and evaluation procedures on students' reading achievement and on their knowledge concerning their own learning. Thirty-nine teachers, each having three or four students in the study, were assigned randomly to measurement/evaluation groups. Experimental group teachers employed continuous evaluation procedures while contrast group teachers employed conventional special education measurement and evaluation procedures. Students were pre- and posttested on an oral passage reading test and they were posttested on the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test, Structural Analysis and Reading Comprehension subtests. Additionally, students were interviewed at the end of the study to assess their knowledge about their own progress. Analyses revealed that experimental students achieved more than contrast group students and were more knowledgeable about their learning. Results suggest that technically adequate, repeated curriculum-based measurement, when used by teachers to evaluate and modify programs, positively affects student achievement. Rating scales, an interview form and training schedules are appended. (Author/PN)

AB  - The study assessed the effects of alternative goal structures within curriculum based assessment (CBA) in the area of math. Subjects were 30 elementary level special education teachers, assigned randomly to a dynamic goal CBA, static goal CBA, or control group for 15 weeks. Two pupils in each class were identified to evaluate the effects of the instructional intervention. In the dynamic goal condition, teachers employed CBA, and (1) modified instructional programs when student progress fell below expectations and (2) increased goals when student progress exceeded expectations. In the static goal condition, teachers employed CBA and modified programs when progress was below expectations, but did not systematically increase goals in response to progress that exceeded anticipated improvement rates. Multivariate analyses of variance conducted on fidelity of treatment measures indicated that dynamic goal teachers increased goals more frequently and, by the study's completion, employed more ambitious goals. Multivariate analyses of covariance indicated that students in the dynamic goal group had better content mastery than control students, whereas students in the static goal group did not. Content coverage for the three groups was comparable. Implications for instructional goal-setting practice are discussed. (Author/DB)

AB  - This study attempted to implement and validate a 5-month effort to transition 42 pupils with mild and moderate disabilities (most with learning disabilities) out of math instruction in special education resource rooms and into regular education math. A preliminary discussion examines the "cascade of services" model and transenvironmental programming as a means of facilitating least restrictive environment student placement. The process utilized computer assisted curriculum based measurement (CBM) to teach math operations in both special and regular education settings. This teaching methodology included goal setting, repeated measurement on goal material, and evaluation of the database to adjust instructional programs. The transenvironmental programming involved four phases: environmental assessment; intervention and preparation; promoting transfer across settings; and evaluation in the mainstream. Evaluation (via a math achievement test, a teacher questionnaire, and CBM data) indicated that experimental students outperformed controls in math achievement and were rated positively by both special and regular class teachers. In addition, whereas all 21 experimental students reintegrated into mainstream math settings either full- or part-time, not a single control student did so. (35 references) (DB)

AB  - Research on teachers' use of Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) for instructional planning indicates that this assessment system can help teachers plan better programs and effect superior academic growth among students with disabilities and other chronically low-achieving students. Given the demonstrated promise of CBM, the author and her colleagues undertook a program of research to explore how computers can be used to surmount difficulties teachers encounter in the areas of reading, spelling, and mathematics. In this chapter, she describes the chronology and purposes of this research program, synthesizes findings, and draws implications for the fields of special and general education, technology, and assessment.

AB  - When teachers use systematic progress monitoring to track their students progress in reading, mathematics, or spelling, they are better able to identify students in need of additional or different forms of instruction, they design stronger instructional programs, and their students achieve better. This document first describes progress monitoring procedures for which experimental evidence demonstrates these effects. Then, an overview of the research is presented. A list of additional readings is provided.

AB  - Progress monitoring focuses on individualized decision making in general and special education with respect to academic skill development at the elementary grades. Progress monitoring is conducted frequently (at least monthly) and is designed to: (1) Estimate rates of improvement; (2) Identify students who are not demonstrating adequate progress and therefore require additional or alternative forms of instruction; and/or; and (3) Compare the efficacy of different forms of instruction and thereby design more effective, individualized instructional programs for problem learners. In this manual, the authors discuss one form of progress monitoring: Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM). CBM provides teachers with an easy and quick method of obtaining empirical information on the progress of their students. With frequently obtained student data, teachers can analyze student scores to adjust student goals and revise their instructional programs. That way, instruction can be tailored to best fit the needs of each student. Research has demonstrated that when teachers use CBM to inform their instructional decision making, students learn more, teacher decision making improves, and students are more aware of their own performance. Included is an annotated bibliography of selected CBM articles. Appendices include: (1) CBM Materials; and (2) Resources. (Contains 59 figures and 54 resources.)

AB  - Given the current emphasis on conducting high-quality experimental studies, it is becoming increasingly important for researchers to accompany their studies with evaluations of the fidelity of implementation of the experimental treatments. This article compares the form and extent of an experimental treatment to student learning. The study involved six middle-school physical science teachers and their students. Videotaped lessons were coded according to their alignment with the treatment's intended structure and processes; results identified a 0.71 correlation between teachers' enactment of formative assessment and student learning. The article suggests that the results of the study may have been due, at least in part, to the failure of many of the experimental-group teachers to implement the treatment as intended.

AB  - Groups of ninth grade biology students equated for mental age, socio-economic status and initial biological knowledge were examined to determine the differential effects on school achievement of announced and unannounced tests. Results showed that (1) a relatively high level of achievement can be expected when students know that tests will be given unexpectedly, (2) greater achievement resulted when announced and unannounced tests were given at longer intervals than when daily tests were used, (3) for brighter pupils it does not matter what testing procedures are used, and (4) for slower pupils 'a warning of a test with time to review the whole appears to be very effective, and an unannounced test on the whole slightly less effective.'

AB  - Formative assessment (FA) is considered a powerful tool to enhance learning. However, there have been few studies addressing how the implementation of FA influences the development of inquiry skills so far. This research intends to determine the efficacy of teaching using FA in the development of students' inquiry skills. A test of inquiry skills was used as the main research instrument to identify the level of the selected inquiry skills before and after a period of teaching with or without FA in the experimental and control group respectively. In the experimental group (n=73), FA was implemented across five subjects: biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and informatics, while the control group (n=48) was taught without any external intervention. In both groups, mostly teacher-centred methods of teaching were applied. The research findings confirmed a low initial level of inquiry skills. Teaching using FA showed higher efficacy than teaching without FA, even without a special focus on the inquiry methods. The experimental group achieved significantly better results compared to the control group. In addition, the results confirmed higher efficacy of FA in lower performing students. Gender did not prove as a determining factor in the effective implementation of FA.

AB  - Five hundred thirty-eight elementary school students participated in a study designed to examine the technical characteristics of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) for the assessment of writing. In addition, the study investigated rating-based measures of writing using the Six Trait model, an assessment instrument and writing program in use in many schools throughout the United States (Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, 2000). Technical characteristics of both models were evaluated. Results indicated that, using the Stanford-9 standard scores for written language subtests as the criterion, most scoring conventions of CBMs for written expression were reliable and valid. Despite adequate interobserver agreement on the Six Trait measures according to scoring conventions, exact agreement was low. The Six Trait measures do not measure distinct components of writing, nor do they share a significant amount of variance with Stanford-9 measures of written expression. CBMs of written expression have shown sufficient technical adequacy across several studies to warrant their use in writing assessment. These results do not support the use of the Six Trait model as a measure of written expression. Implications for research are presented.

AB  - The assessment of students' academic achievements helps to increase learning effectiveness by encouraging each student to recognise his/her strengths and areas for improvement. To do so, pedagogical activities that encourage direct and frequent evaluation must be considered. This paper focuses on how a learning management system such as Google Classroom (GC) together with learning analytics (LA) can be used to extract and analyse learner's data from Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) course. In addition, we explore how to employ these data to support metacognitive skills such as self-regulated learning (SRL). An explanatory sequential mixed-method design research was used, and two research questions were set, discussed and analysed. Data collection involved 128 participants. Our findings confirmed the potential of using achievement-based grading rubrics data and LA tools to provide empirical evidence of how formative assessment can affect students' SRL development. While onsite experience has revealed some important initial findings, further research is needed. To validate these results, it will be necessary to perform similar analyses on datasets obtained from other schools and subject areas. Despite the increasing interest in use of LA, there is a scarcity of research on this field for secondary school education.

AB  - This meta-analysis is a review of how curriculum based measurement (CBM), short-term memory, and processing speed, relate to both basic reading skills and reading comprehension. This was developed due to the debate in the field of school psychology on the utility of using cognitive measures as important and relevant variables in the identification of learning disabilities. The goal of this study was to determine the strength of association of these variables to reading abilities and to determine if the strength of association between curriculum based measurement differed significantly from short-term memory and processing speed when compared to reading. In order for studies to be included, they must have met several criteria, including: Publication on or after 1990, participants must have been between the ages of 4 and 14, outcome measures must have been one of the Woodcock reading or tests of achievement, and reliabilities of measures must have exceeded .70. Each predictor variable was compared to both basic reading skills and reading comprehension to determine strength of association (effect size). Finally, the short-term memory and processing speed variables were combined to create a “cognitive processing” moderator variable to compare strengths of association between CBM and cognitive processing when predicting reading. The results indicated large effect sizes ranging from .618-.636 for CBM when predicting basic reading and reading comprehension. Moderate effect sizes ranging from .387-.433 were obtained when comparing short-term memory and processing speed to both basic reading and reading comprehension. CBM showed a significantly (p<.05) greater effect to basic reading than cognitive processing when sample size was controlled, although there was not a significant difference when this comparison was made to reading comprehension. Limitations of the study included the breadth of narrow abilities under the terms “short-term memory” and “processing speed”, exclusion of other important variables (such as sex or whether one had a disability) when determining reading skills, narrow parameters of allowable tests, no independent coders used for the analysis, and a narrow focus on reading for this study. The implications of these findings to school psychology are discussed.

AB  - 30 public school classes, containing 1,078 pupils from grades II A to VI B inclusive, were given an 80-word test in October, 1931. On the basis of initial scores, pupils in each half-grade 'were matched so as to form groups of identical distribution in initial ability.' Content and instruction were prescribed, and were ostensibly comparable, except for the number of tests given during the experiment, which continued until January, 1932. Superiority is indicated for the two-test plan in grades II A to IV A; for grades IV B to VI B, the results are inconclusive. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A pilot program, established at Griffin Creek School (Medford, Oregon) from September 1970 to June 1971, consisted of five Laubach-trained volunteer reading tutors, an experimental group of five fifth- and sixth-grade boys, and a control group of eighteen boys and girls in a regular classroom. The experimental boys, reading at a second- or third-grade level at the beginning of the project, met four days a week with their individual tutors and once weekly for an hour of group instruction. Control group students were reading at levels ranging from the second grade to the sixth grade. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests (1965) were administered to both groups at the beginning and at the end of the project, with the experimental group receiving an additional testing in April 1971. Results showed that the range of reading gain for the experimental group was from nine to sixteen months, that 100 percent of the experimental group showed a gain in the comprehensive or vocabulary test sections, and that the range for the control group was from a loss of four months to a gain of 27 months, with 89 percent showing some gain in comprehension or vocabulary. Appendixes provide reading scores, a lesson plan guide, and a rationale for letter sound mnemonics. (JM)

AB  - Interteaching is a behavioral teaching method that has been empirically shown to increase student learning outcomes. The present study investigated the effect of combining interteaching with cumulative versus noncumulative exams in two sections of an online asynchronous class. Interteaching was used in both sections of the course. The noncumulative exam section experienced weekly exams with test questions that only covered material learned in that week of class. The cumulative exam section was given weekly exams in which half of the questions were from material learned that current week and the other half were cumulative up to that point in the class. This was followed by a cumulative final exam given to both groups. All exam questions were multiple choice. On average, students in the cumulative exam group scored 4.91% higher on the final exam than students in the noncumulative exam group. Students exposed to weekly cumulative exams also earned more As and Bs on the final compared to the noncumulative exam group. Overall, our experiment provides evidence that interteaching may be further improved when combined with cumulative weekly exams.

AB  - The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize findings from 42 interventions (randomized control trials and quasi-experimental studies) on instructional approaches that enhance the mathematics proficiency of students with learning disabilities. We examined the impact of four categories of instructional components: (a) approaches to instruction and/or curriculum design, (b) formative assessment data and feedback to teachers on students' mathematics performance, (c) formative data and feedback to students with LD on their performance, and (d) peer-assisted mathematics instruction. All instructional components except for student feedback with goal-setting and peer-assisted learning within a class resulted in significant mean effects ranging from 0.21 to 1.56. We also examined the effectiveness of these components conditionally, using hierarchical multiple regressions. Two instructional components provided practically and statistically important increases in effect size-teaching students to use heuristics and explicit instruction. Limitations of the study, suggestions for future research, and applications for improvement of current practice are discussed. (Contains 2 notes and 2 tables.)

AB  - Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) is a systematic, ongoing assessment framework that allows special educators to monitor students' progress and determine the need for instructional adaptations. Jenkins and colleagues examined the accuracy and timeliness of six different schedules of CBM progress monitoring (PM). The authors found that weekly and intermittent PM schedules were similarly accurate and timely. This study replicated and extended the work of Jenkins and colleagues by examining the accuracy and timeliness of different PM schedules for 51 students with disabilities. Results indicated that the accuracy and timeliness of the PM schedules for the current sample was poorer than the accuracy and timeliness reported by Jenkins and colleagues. In line with the results of the original study, however, these results indicated that intermittent PM schedules sufficiently predicted student true growth compared to weekly PM schedule. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - The present study aimed at investigating the effect of weekly quizzes on Iranian high school students‘ performance on final achievement tests. This effect, which is technically referred to as washback, is defined as the effect of testing on learning and teaching. Most scholars have attempted to provide guidelines in order to achieve positive washback. While some suggest frequent quizzes as a means of positive washback, others oppose the idea. The proponents claim that frequent quizzes stimulate practice and review, give the students more opportunities for feedback and have a positive influence on students‘ study time. The opponents, on the other hand, believe that too frequent testing might inhibit of larger units of instructional material and frustrate anxious students, and thus, hinder learning. This study explored whether students taking weekly quizzes performed better in the final achievement tests. 70 students studying in grade two of high school were selected and divided into two groups. One group received weekly quizzes and the other group took only midterm exam. The results indicated that the group with weekly quizzes performed better than the group without quizzes.

AB  - Investigated the effects of an instructional intervention incorporating curriculum-based assessment (CBA) principles on 17 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders at risk of learning failure in general mathematics. 10 Ss received specially designed instructional materials (SDIMs) twice a week for 9 wks, while controls received assignments designed by their teachers. The SDIMs provided corrective feedback and practice to Ss. There were significant between-group differences on teacher semester grades, Academic Learning Time (C. Denham and A. Lieberman, 1980) task variables, and decision to remain in class. Improved instruction may help combat factors that perpetuate failure and eventually lead to school dropout.

AB  - Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) tools are used widely to assess students' progress within different stages of the Response to Intervention (RTI) process. Despite the wide-spread use, little research has identified the efficacy of reading CBMs in predicting secondary student outcomes on high-stakes assessments. High-stakes assessments are being utilized to determine outcomes for not just students, but teachers, administrators, and districts. More research is needed to determine if reading CBMs are useful tools for the populations of struggling secondary readers. The current study was a secondary analysis of existing data, which attempted to gain an understanding of this through examining the predictive validity of CBMs and high-stakes pre-assessments on end-of-year outcomes. The population included struggling, seventh grade readers who had not demonstrated proficiency on previous state tests and who attended urban schools representing low socio-economic status and high ethnic diversity. Results identified previous year state tests and norm-referenced tests as significant predictors of end-of-year outcomes, both individually and in combination. Though the reading fluency CBMs accounted for some variance in the regression equation, the amount was negligible. Student ethnicity and group status (i.e., whether received intervention) were not significant predictors of end-of year outcomes. These results indicate that CBMs may not provide additional valuable information in the prediction of student outcomes for secondary struggling readers. This finding is important for educators to weigh with other concerns, such as ease of use and time constraints, as existing pre-assessments (i.e., state tests, norm-referenced screening tools) may provide enough information without the additional use of CBMs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the basic psychometric properties of a progress-monitoring tool designed to measure narrative discourse skills in school-age children with language impairments (LI). A sample of 109 children with LI between the ages of 5 years 7 months and 9 years 9 months completed the Test of Narrative Language (TNL). The stories told in response to the alien picture prompt were transcribed and scored according to the TNL manual criteria and the criteria established for scoring the progress-monitoring tool, Monitoring Indicators of Scholarly Language (MISL). The MISL total score demonstrated acceptable levels of internal consistency reliability, inter-rater reliability, and construct validity for use as a progress-monitoring tool for specific aspects of narrative proficiency. The MISL holds promise as a tool for tracking growth in narrative language proficiency that may be taught as part of an intervention program to support the Common Core Standards related to literacy.

AB  - One of the successes of learning is the formation of thinking skills and understanding. Therefore in this study the formative assessment is implemented through Understanding by Design (UbD). The research objective is to find out the formation of understanding and to analyze the correlation between formative assessments and UbD. The study used quantitative method with a quasi-experimental design. Formative assessment strategies used were presentations, discussions, practicum learning, mind-mapping, and analyzing articles. The results of the study found that there was a significant increase in understanding after the implementation of formative assessment through UbD and a positive correlation between formative assessment and understanding. Formative assessment integrated into UbD is the originality of this research.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to look at the literature on the effect of frequent testing on academic achievement from a meta-analytic perspective. For this purpose, a broad literature review was conducted and after the studies were reviewed and inclusion criteria were applied, 78 experimental or quasi-experimental studies on the effectiveness of academic achievement were selected as the final study sample. Although methodologies and designs of the studies varied, they all searched whether delivering frequent classroom tests would make a difference on academic achievement on a later on a final exam. Finding the overall effect size for the studies on the effectiveness of frequent testing was the main research question. Besides this, many study characteristics formed the additional research questions. For Example, the study looked at if using the same or different instructors to teach the experimental and control groups would make a difference on the achievement, whether there was a difference between studies of frequent testing on college level and high school level, whether offering feedback only to the experimental group would influence the results and more methodological and study characteristics that might influence the results are formed the additional research questions. Results indicate that frequent testing increases academic achievement by 0.43 standard deviation. This is an almost medium effect size according to Cohen's criteria. Although the overall affect size is almost medium in the size, most of the moderator variables that were thought to be related to frequent testing did not found to be significant. Only significant difference is found between the studies coming from different publication sources and between the published and not published studies. According to results, journal articles had a large mean effect size value as it was expected. Again not surprisingly published studies had a large mean effect size. The major implication this study provides is for the future researcher of frequent testing. The study searches in dept the characteristics of frequent testing studies, that way it is easier for future researchers of frequent testing to see the major design mistakes and prevent them from happening in their designs.

AB  - Faith schools are popular with parents and feature towards the top of the annual tables of school performance in England based on the government's preferred measures of school outcomes. Academic studies suggest that although the observed differentials between the faith and non-faith sectors at the end of Key Stage 4 are partly explicable in demographic and similar terms, they do nonetheless represent a real phenomenon. There is little research into the causes of this. The simplest hypothesis is that pupils attending faith schools take more examinations, thus boosting their average points scores. The possible additional courses are, by inference, in Religious Education. This study examines the hypothesis and finds it wanting as an adequate explanation. Further areas of research are suggested.

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the use of interim assessments and the policy supports that promote use to improve instruction, focusing on elementary school mathematics. The authors use the term "interim assessments" to refer to assessments that a) evaluate student knowledge and skills, typically within a limited time frame; and b) the results of which can be easily aggregated and analyzed across classrooms, schools, or even districts. Drawing on in-depth case studies of nine elementary schools located in two school districts, this study addresses four questions: (1) What policy supports at the school and district levels enhance the use of interim assessments to change instruction? How does instructional support, the nature of professional development, the sophistication of local data systems, and the school- and teacher-level incentives for improved instruction affect teachers' use of interim assessment data?; (2) How do elementary school teachers, individually and collectively, learn from interim assessment results in mathematics and apply that knowledge to instructional decisions about content, pedagogy, and working with individual students?; (3) In what ways are interim assessments situated within the wider context of teachers' formative assessment practices and tools?; and (4) What is the relationship among teacher capacity, analysis of assessment information, and teaching practice? This paper synthesizes the study's findings and discusses implications for the design of more effective interim assessment policies and practices. Each chapter contains figures, footnotes and references.

AB  - Early literacy intervention is a critical component in helping all children learn to read. Progress monitoring within Response to Intervention models is a necessary guiding tool for good instructional practice. The purpose of this study was to compare the use of Running Records to oral reading fluency curriculum-based measures. Over a period of five months, at-risk readers in two rural schools were progress-monitored. Both the measures and the results were compared to ascertain which measure was more advantageous for planning instruction. Results indicated the Running Record reading levels were highly correlated to curriculum-based oral reading fluency measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The testing effect is a finding from cognitive psychology with relevance for education. It shows that after an initial study period, taking a practice test improves long-term retention compared to not taking a test and-more interestingly-compared to restudying the learning material. Boundary conditions of the effect that have received attention include the test format, retrieval success on the initial test, the retention interval, or the spacing of tests. Another potential boundary condition concerns the complexity of learning materials, that is, the number of interacting information elements a learning task contains. This insight is not new, as research from a century ago already had indicated that the testing effect decreases as the complexity of learning materials increases, but that finding seems to have been nearly forgotten. Studies presented in this special issue suggest that the effect may even disappear when the complexity of learning material is very high. Since many learning tasks in schools are high in element interactivity, a failure to find the effect under these conditions is relevant for education. Therefore, this special issue hopes to put this potential boundary condition back on the radar and provide a starting point for discussion and future research on this topic.

AB  - Educational accountability and its counterpart, high-stakes assessment, are at the forefront of the educational agenda in this era of standards-based reform. In this article, we examine assessment and accountability in the context of a prevention-oriented assessment and intervention system designed to assess early reading progress formatively. Specifically, we explore the utility of a continuum of fluency-based indicators of foundational early literacy skills to predict reading outcomes, to inform educational decisions, and to change reading outcomes for students at risk of reading difficulty. First, we address the accountability era, discuss the promise of prevention-oriented assessment, and outline a continuum of fluency-based indicators of foundational reading skills using Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills and Curriculum-Based Measurement Oral Reading Fluency. Next, we describe a series of linked, short-term, longitudinal studies of 4 cohorts examining the utility and predictive validity of the measures from kindergarten through 3rd grade with the Oregon Statewide Assessment-Reading/Literature as a high-stakes reading outcome. Using direct measures of key foundational skills, predictive validities ranged from .34 to .82. The utility of the fluency-based benchmark goals was supported with the finding that 96% of children who met the 3rd-grade oral reading fluency benchmark goal met or exceeded expectations on the Oregon Statewide Assessment, a high-stakes outcome measure. We illustrate the utility of the measures for evaluating instruction, modifying the instructional system, and targeting children who need additional instructional support to achieve benchmark goals. Finally, we discuss the instructional and policy implications of our findings and their utility in an active educational accountability environment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The spacing effect refers to the frequently observed finding that distributing learning across time leads to better retention than massing it into one single study session. In the present study, we examined whether the spacing effect generalises to primary school vocabulary learning. To this aim, children from Grade 3 were taught the meaning of 15 new words using a massed procedure and 15 other new words using a spaced procedure. The 15 words in the massed condition were divided into three sets of five words, and each set was taught three times in one of three learning sessions. In the spaced condition, learning was distributed across the three sessions: All 15 words were practised once in each of the three learning sessions. At the retention tests after 1 week and after 5 weeks we observed that the meaning of spaced words was remembered better than the meaning of massed words.

AB  - The testing effect refers to the finding that retrieval practice leads to better long-term retention than additional study of course material. In the present study, we examined whether this finding generalizes to primary school vocabulary learning. We also manipulated the word learning context. Children were introduced to 20 words by listening to a story in which novel words were embedded (story condition) or by listening to isolated words (word pairs condition). The children practised the meaning of 10 words by retrieval practice and 10 words by restudy. After 1 week, they completed a cued recall test and a multiple choice test. Words learned by retrieval practice were recalled better than words learned by additional study, but there was no difference in recognition. Furthermore, the children in the word pairs condition outperformed the children in the story condition. These results show that retrieval practice may improve vocabulary learning in children.

AB  - The testing effect is the phenomenon that retrieval practice of learning material after studying enhanceslong-term retention more than restudying. We examined retrieval practice in primary school vocabularylearning in two experiments. Nine-year-old children studied word definitions and completed exercisesaccording to three learning conditions: pure restudy, elaborative restudy or retrieval practice. Children inthe pure restudy condition reread and partly copied the definitions. In the elaborative restudy conditionchildren reread the definitions and connected semantically related words to the target words. Childrenin the retrieval practice condition recalled the words based on their definitions. Overall, on the fill-in-the-blank test after one week children in the retrieval practice condition outperformed children in theother conditions, but on the multiple-choice test there were no differences. Retrieval practice may beeffective for primary school vocabulary learning, but there is uncertainty about the practical value andthe magnitude of the retrieval practice effect.

AB  - Distributed practice and retrieval practice are promising learning strategies to use in education. We examined the effects of these strategies in primary school vocabulary lessons. Grades 2, 3, 4, and 6 children performed exercises that were part of the regular curriculum. For the distributed practice manipulation, the children performed six exercises distributed within 1 week (short-lag repetition) or across 2 weeks (long-lag repetition). For the repetition type manipulation, children copied a part of the description of a word (restudy) or recalled the description (retrieval practice). At the end of each week, the children received a cued-recall vocabulary test. After 1 to 11 weeks they received a multiple-choice vocabulary test. Both on the cued-recall test and on the multiple-choice test no benefits of long-lag repetition and retrieval practice were found. These results put into question the practical value of long-lag repetition and retrieval practice in real-life primary school vocabulary lessons.

AB  - During this decade there have been numerous efforts to identify instructional practices that improve students' writing. These include "Reading Next" (Biancarosa and Snow, 2004), which provided a set of instructional recommendations for improving writing, and "Writing Next" (Graham and Perin, 2007) and "Writing to Read" (Graham and Hebert, 2010), which were systematic reviews of high-quality research that identified effective writing practices for improving both writing and reading, respectively. Despite these efforts and efforts by others (e.g., Bangert-Drowns, Hurley, and Wilkinson, 2004; Rogers and Graham, 2008), educators and policymakers need additional evidence-based practices for improving the writing of students in American schools. One tool with potential for improving students' ability to effectively convey thoughts and ideas through text is classroom-based writing assessment. Such formative assessments allow teachers to gauge the effectiveness of their instructional practices, modify instruction as needed, and provide students with feedback on writing strengths and areas in need of further development. These assessments can be administered in a variety of ways in the classroom, including teachers assessing students' writing, students assessing their own writing, and peers assessing others' writing. This report provides evidence to answer the following two questions: (1) Does formative writing assessment enhance students' writing?; and (2) How can teachers improve formative writing assessment in the classroom? This is the first report to examine the effectiveness of formative writing assessment (question 1) using the powerful statistical method of meta-analysis. This technique allows researchers to determine the "consistency" and "strength" of the effects of an instructional practice, and to highlight practices holding the most promise. This report also identifies best practices in writing assessment that need to be implemented in order to maximize the accuracy and trustworthiness of formative writing assessment (question 2). Appended are: (1) Methodology; and (2) Studies and Data Examined in the Report. (Contains 15 tables.)

AB  - To determine whether formative writing assessments that are directly tied to everyday classroom teaching and learning enhance students' writing performance, we conducted a meta-analysis of true and quasi-experiments conducted with students in grades 1 to 8. We found that feedback to students about writing from adults, peers, self, and computers statistically enhanced writing quality, yielding average weighted effect sizes of 0.87, 0.58, 0.62, and 0.38, respectively. We did not find, however, that teachers' monitoring of students' writing progress or implementation of the 6 + 1 Trait Writing model meaningfully enhanced students' writing. The findings from this meta-analysis provide support for the use of formative writing assessments that provide feedback directly to students as part of everyday teaching and learning. We argue that such assessments should be used more frequently by teachers, and that they should play a stronger role in the Next-Generation Assessment Systems being developed by Smarter Balanced and PARCC.

AB  - This study shows that formative methods and increased student participation has a positive influence on learning measured as grades. The study was conducted during the course Biology A in a Swedish Upper Secondary School. The students constructed grade criteria and defined working methods and type of examination within a given topic, Gene technology. The procedure resulted in variation within teaching and examination carried out as an oral test in small groups. In the analysis, students’ grades on Gene technology were analysed in comparison with grades on other topics within the course, and the results show that mean grade is significantly higher on Gene technology. Based on the results and student course evaluations, I discuss the reasons behind the good results and the relation to participation, student interest, teacher and type of examination.

AB  - In this paper, we share the results of the piloting of national diagnostic assessments for strategic calculation with Grade 3 learners in South Africa. The diagnostic assessment pilot intervention was focused on promoting strategic use of calculation strategies and aimed to move learners on from the concrete one-to-one counting methods that persist in this grade and into higher grades. Working with a broader team of mathematics education specialists, including international leaders in the field and department of education representatives, we designed a series of assessments that focus on key calculation strategies such as bridging through ten. Each assessment, comprised a pre- and repeat post-assessment, was accompanied by interim lesson starters for teacher use in eight 10-min mental mathematics sessions. These were designed to develop learner fluency in each of the focal strategies and related skills. The pre- and post-assessments allow teachers to track improvement in student learning. The pilot focused on the "bridging through ten" strategy in seven classes across the Eastern Cape and Gauteng provinces. Positive results indicate that the format of these assessments paired with the lesson starters is potentially useful for broader national trialling and implementation. This work feeds into the need for diagnostic assessments that inform teaching focused on strategic efficiency rather than simply accepting correct answers produced through highly inefficient methods.

AB  - Should young children be tested? Proponents view early testing as a necessary instrument for early targeting. Others consider it detrimental to child mental health and with little impact on educational performance. We exploit variation in testtaking in mathematics among primary school children in Norway, traditionally a low-testing environment. We examine both the introduction of difficult mathematics tests and simpler screening tests that were aimed at identifying children in need of assistance. We demonstrate zero effects of testing exposure on later attainment but some benefits from screening tests for low-performing students. There are no negative effects on student welfare, but testing appears to improve aspects of teaching practices, feedback and engagement.

AB  - This article outlines the impact of an eight-week Precision Teaching (PT) intervention on the sight vocabulary, reading fluency and reading attainment scores of a group of Irish primary school pupils. This study also sought to evaluate the role of PT in facilitating formative assessment of pupils' progress. Employing a mixed-method approach, this study comprised a quasi-experimental design and qualitative interviews involving 40 Irish primary school pupils and seven Learning Support Teachers. Following intervention, a mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance confirmed the differential growth in sight vocabulary scores across the control and intervention groups. Notably, the latter group displayed a greater increase in magnitude in sight vocabulary following intervention, paralleled by statistically significant increases in reading accuracy, fluency and comprehension standard scores and overall reading ability composite scores. Semi-structured interviews highlighted PT as an effective strategy in facilitating formative assessment and a highly motivational tool in education. Results are interpreted in light of relevant literature, with implications for practice and future research discussed.

AB  - Since the introduction of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), districts across the country implemented computerized benchmark, or interim assessments, into their curriculum as a means to monitor and improve student achievement. Often, a change in curriculum entails a demand of educators' time, whether through professional development or lesson planning, and therefore affects teachers' attitudes. The purpose of this study was to determine what, if any, relationship there was among middle school teachers' attitudes, monthly computerized benchmark assessments, and student scores on the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP). Educators of the communication arts and mathematics content areas from one middle school were administered a survey and questionnaire to address two questions: 1) What are teachers' attitudes regarding the use of the Tungsten Learning System in the areas of reading and mathematics, and 2) How, if at all, do teachers change their behaviors in regards to the monthly reports of the Tungsten Learning System? Both assessment tools addressed categories of Training or Comfort Level, Use of Tungsten Feedback, Teachers' Perceptions of Tungsten, Accountability, and Student Preparation and Motivation. To observe if there was a difference in student achievement, as measured by the MAP, test scores of students from two middle schools of the same district, since the implementation of the Tungsten Learning System, were analyzed using ANOVA. In conclusion, the study found there was a difference in student achievement in mathematics MAP scores. Also, based on the survey and questionnaire responses, teachers did not believe Tungsten Learning System was a good predictor of student achievement. However, overall they favored computerized benchmark assessments if not administered monthly, aligned with the curriculum, provided student feedback and effective re-teaching tools, and they felt they were adequately trained. Teachers did believe their attitudes had more of an effect on their students' attitudes than on students' achievement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Use of strategic questioning as the formative assessment is one of the strategies that advocates the improvement of learners' performance in Mathematics. The study assessed the contribution of strategic questioning to the improvement and development of the foundation of knowledge of learners to come up with improved performance and developed a plan of strategic questioning. The experimental evaluation design-posttest only was used with posttest for both control and experimental groups. The experimental groups were exposed to the treatment. Data gathered through a checklist and plan for strategic questioning were developed. Two hundred twenty-five students under the researcher were randomly selected as control and experimental groups. Data were statistically treated with percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test, and p-test. It was found out that there was a significant difference between the performance of students in the controlled and experimental groups after instruction/intervention. This meant that strategic questioning as formative assessment contributes to the effective performance of the learners in mathematics. It can be inferred further that categorizing questioning to the lower level and higher level can really increase the learners' performance in math. The research revealed then that using contextualized problems/lessons as one form of strategic questioning in every quarter contributed to improving the learners' competence in solving math problems.

AB  - This paper reviews the literature on mastery learning theory and reports its successful application since 1987 with mainstreamed special education students at one elementary school in Missouri. The methodology, originally developed by Benjamin Bloom, involves formative evaluation after initial instruction followed by either corrective activities and reevaluation or by enrichment activities. Use of mastery learning is reported to result in substantially increased student achievement for both regular and special education students. At the Thorpe-Gordon elementary school in Jefferson City, Missouri, the techniques of mastery learning are being used in regular classes in which 40 mildly disabled and at risk students from the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades are mainstreamed. The regular class teacher provides the initial instruction and administers the first formative assessment. Corrective instruction is then provided within the classroom to students who have not attained mastery while the regular teacher provides enrichment activities to the remaining students. Standardized test results show that only 10%, compared to 40% previously, of students achieve in the bottom two quintiles with 50-75% achieving in the highest quintile. Grades of the mainstreamed students and comments of teachers also support the program's success. Includes 19 references. (DB)

AB  - Although much recent attention has focused on gaps in the achievement of different groups of students, the problem has been with us for decades. This paper presents the problem as one of reducing variation in students' achievement, and reviews the work of renowned educator Benjamin Bloom on this problem. Bloom argued that to reduce variation in students' achievement and to have all students learn well, we must increase variation in instructional approaches and learning time. The key element in this effort is well constructed, formative classroom assessments. Bloom outlined a specific strategy for using formative classroom assessments to guide teachers in differentiating their instruction and labeled it "mastery learning." This paper describes Bloom's work, presents the essential elements of mastery learning, explains common misinterpretations, and describes the results of research on its effects. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - We present quantitative results from the pilot-year of a large scale Swedish educational project in reading development called LegiLexi, inspired by research within the Response to intervention and Formative assessment traditions. The vision of the project is that every pupil should reach adequate reading skills at the end of grade 3 in primary school. LegiLexi contains a formative assessment tool and a teacher course, which are linked together. We describe LegiLexi and analyze quantitative effects of the pilot year regarding reading development for pupils in grade 1. The design included three conditions; full access to LegiLexi, access only to the formative assessment tool, and control. Results showed that the group with full access to LegiLexi improved their word decoding and reading comprehension the most. For language comprehension, the Formative assessment only group showed the highest improvements. Thus, the features of LegiLexi seem to help enhance critical reading skills. Some changes will be made in the project to strengthen methodological aspects and further facilitate pupils' reading development.

AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether a particular diagnostic assessment and monitoring program would have an effect on class achievement, regardless of curriculum used. The program consisted of a series of criterion-referenced tests coordinated with sequenced lessons in reading, oral language, and arithmetic, with the results charted by skill and pupil. These results formed a basis for ongoing assistance to the teacher by an inservice teacher trainer or supervisor. Conducted in an urban school district with poor pupil achievement, heavy bilingualism, and low pupil socioeconomic status, the study used an experimental pretest posttest comparison group design. All teachers were instructed to use the district's specific language program daily. There were three subtests--phonics, reading vocabulary, and reading comprehension--and a total reading score. Although the comparison group began with higher pretest results in every subtest, the experimental group scored higher in every area except reading vocabulary, and made greater gains in every subtest. However, none of the results reached significance. For the experimental group, covering more lessons in the language program, together with the diagnostic inservice training, resulted in a significant positive correlation between lesson day in program and the posttest scores on every subtest. The more the experimental group teachers covered in the language program, the higher the resulting scores in all areas. (Tables of findings are included.) (HTH)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between quiz frequency and student achievement in eighth-grade mathematics as measured by TIMSS. The more specific goal of the study was determining the best quiz frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, no quizzes) and student achievement relationship for an eighth-grade mathematics course. The study investigated the above-mentioned relationship in all of the eighth-grade of participant countries combined, as well as in four specific countries: Korea, Singapore, Turkey, and the United States. Another goal of the study was to determine high performing and low performing countries’ quizzing practices, and to determine the best relationship of quiz frequency and student achievement in these countries. The study obtained data from the TIMSS 2011 exam and from student, teacher, and school questionnaires. In addition to quiz practices, students’ and schools’ SES data were also used in this study as control variables. Quiz frequency data (independent variable) were retrieved from teacher questionnaires, socioeconomic status (SES) data (control variables) were retrieved from student and school questionnaires, and student achievement data were retrieved from the TIMSS 2011 exam. Several multiple linear regressions were performed to determine whether quiz frequency is a significant predictor of student achievement in all countries combined, as well as in individual countries. Regression results indicated that quizzing frequency is not a significant contributor to student achievement in eighth-grade mathematics, either in all countries combined or in individual countries after controlling for SES variables. Furthermore, regression results indicated that weekly quizzes had the best relationship in all countries, monthly quizzes in the top two performing countries (Korea and Singapore), and daily quizzes in Turkey and the United States. Results also indicated that almost all teachers use quizzes. Moreover, the study also found that SES status is a significant contributor to student achievement, and that student achievement significantly and constantly increased as student SES status improve.

AB  - This study compares the system of presenting ail spelling words at the beginning of the week and testing at the end of the week with a system of presenting a portion of the words each day and daily testing. Academic performance of 13 fourth-grade students in a combination fourth- and fifth-grade classroom was measured by recording scores on weekly spelling tests. The results reveal a significant increase in spelling performance on the weekly tests when students receive a portion of their spelling words each day. Questionnaires given to the students and parents indicate that they felt a positive change in both effort and academic achievement when the students were distributed and tested daily on a portion of the words.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a novel research-supported testing method called The SPARK (Spiraling Assessment to Reinforce Knowledge) Testing Method on 8th-grade students' end-of-course (EOC) test scores in algebra I. An overview of relevant learning theories and inconsistencies between these theories and classroom assessments was described. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used to address the research question. A total of 284 EOC algebra I test scores were obtained from the math facilitator of a large urban school district. EOC test scores were analyzed to determine the means and standard deviations of students assessed by a SPARK teacher and those assessed by seven non-SPARK teachers. The students' Iowa Assessment math standard scores (M1314) from the year prior to taking algebra I were used as the covariate to account for incoming differences in math achievement. An ANCOVA was used to examine differences in EOC means adjusted for prior math achievement between students assessed by the SPARK teacher and the non-SPARK teachers. The results showed that students assessed by the SPARK teacher on average performed as well as or better than students assessed by non-SPARK teachers. Effect sizes for statistically significant mean differences between SPARK and non-SPARK teachers ranged from medium to large. Within the discussion section, a strong case was made for linkages between the SPARK method and instruction aligned with learning theories related to cognitivism and constructivism. Overall findings and restriction of this study to one subject area and grade level emphasize that further research is needed into the effectiveness of the SPARK testing method to understand the role of weekly, cumulative, and comprehensive assessment formats on student learning across disciplines and age groups.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of technology-integrated formative assessment strategies on students' retention of conceptual and procedural knowledge in chemical equilibrium concepts. A quasi-experimental control group interrupted time series design was employed. Data were collected from 132 students, who were selected using a random sampling technique from three governmental secondary schools. Two experimental groups and one comparison group were involved in the study. A series of chemical equilibrium conceptual and procedural tests were used to collect data. A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the test scores. The three groups had varied mean gain scores in conceptual and procedural examination scores as repeated measurements of time, as can be observed from the descriptive statistics. The two-way mixed ANOVA findings revealed that there was a significant main effect between groups on conceptual test scores. Furthermore, on conceptual knowledge test scores, there was a significant interaction between time point and intervention groups. On procedural examination scores, there was also a significant difference between the 3-time points and intervention groups. A significant interaction between time points and groups was also observed. Given that there was a significant difference between the pre-test, post-test, and follow-up post-test scores in the experimental group, with the difference favoring the post-test scores, it can be concluded that the technology-integrated formative assessment strategy is successful in raising secondary school students' conceptual and procedural test scores.

AB  - Math skills are essential to daily life, impacting a person's ability to function at home, work, and in the community. Although reading has been the focus in recent years, many students struggle in math. The inability to master math calculation and problem solving has contributed to the rising incidence of student failure, referrals for special education evaluations, and dropout rates. Studies have shown that curriculum based measurement (CBM) is a well-established tool for formative assessment, and could potentially be used for other purposes such as a prediction of state standards test scores, however to date there are limited validity studies between mathematics CBM and standard-based assessment. This research examined a brief assessment that reported to be aligned to national curriculum standards in order to predict student performance on state standards-based mathematics curriculum, identify students at-risk of failure, and plan instruction. Evidence was gathered on the "System to Enhance Educational Performance Grade 3 Focal Mathematics Assessment Instrument" (STEEP3M) as a formative, universal screener. Using a sample of 337 students and 22 instructional staff, four qualities of the STEEP3M were examined: (a) internal consistency and criterion related validity (concurrent); (b) screening students for a multi-tiered decision-making process; (c) utility for instructional planning and intervention recommendations; and (d) efficiency of administration, scoring, and reporting results which were the basis of the four research questions for this study. Several optimized solutions were generated from Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) statistical analysis; however none demonstrated that the STEEP3M maximized either sensitivity or specificity. In semi-structured interviews teachers reported that they would consider using the STEEP3M, however only as a part of a decision-making rubric along with other measures. Further, teachers indicated that lessons are developed before the school year starts, more in response to the sequence of the state standards than to students' needs. While the STEEP3M was sufficiently long enough for high-stakes or criterion-referenced decisions, this study found that the test does not provide sufficient diagnostic information for multi-tiered decision-making for intervention or instructional planning. Although practical and efficient to administer, the conclusions of this study show the test does not provide sufficient information on the content domain and does not accurately classify students in need of assistance.

AB  - In this mixed-method, applied research study, the researcher attempted to increase the skills of the students and the teachers to increase the number of sixth-grade students who would score proficient or advanced on the MAAP’s end-of-year assessment. An increased number of proficient sixth-grade mathematics students improves proficiency throughout middle and secondary schools, and it improves college and career readiness. Furthermore, an increase in proficient sixth-grade students improves individual lives and community economics. In this study, the researcher used curriculum-based measurement (CBM) formative assessments to track students’ performance and to drive the teacher’s instruction. The research study was performed at a middle school in northwest Mississippi in the classroom of a sixth-grade mathematics teacher. Discrete, quantitative statistics were used to analyze the students’ academic performance before, during, and after the CBM progress-monitoring implementation. The data from the teacher instructional adaptability and responsiveness to the students’ specific academic needs were analyzed before and after implementing CBM progress monitoring. The action plan was focused on student progress monitoring with appropriate correctives and feedback implemented as dictated by the process data and the decision model. Instructional changes were monitored for appropriateness and effectiveness. Program evaluation data were collected from formative, interim, and summative assessments. Teacher interviews, pre- and postobservation of classroom conferences, and classroom observations provided qualitative data and insights. Findings were reported according to output data when answering the research questions.

AB  - In the research reviewed for this study, there is strong evidence and consensus among researchers that the formative assessment process used by teachers and students during instruction has very powerful and positive effects on student achievement. Summative, large scale assessments, and a focus on standards and accountability that ignore the process of teaching and learning in classroom, do not provide the direction that teachers need to inform instruction and improve student learning. The purpose of this study was to determine the relation between “end of year” student growth on the Northwest Evaluation Association/Measures of Academic Performance (NWEA/MAP) reading assessments and teachers’ classroom formative assessment practices. For the purpose of this study, end of year classroom assessment results were compared to teacher formative assessment survey results. Results of this study revealed an overall significant positive effect on reading achievement in classrooms where teachers engage in more frequent use of formative assessment strategies. On average, teachers who engage in more frequent use (1–3 times a day) of formative assessment strategies compared to teachers who engage in less frequent use (1–3 times a week or less) of these strategies, realized a significant, positive effect of plus sixteen (+16%) on the end of year classroom reading results as measured by the NWEA/MAP assessment. Of the teachers in this study who were identified with higher end of year reading growth and achievement results, three of twelve formative assessment strategies were used significantly more often by these teachers than others were: 1) opportunities for students to analyze models of strong and weak work as it relates to the intended learning, 2) students in their classrooms can communicate what they are learning and what steps they need to take to reach their learning goals, 3) students receive feedback that is descriptive and interactive.

Of the teachers in this study who were identified with higher end of year reading growth and achievement results, three of twelve formative assessment strategies were used significantly more often by these teachers than others were: 1) opportunities for students to analyze models of strong and weak work as it relates to the intended learning, 2) students in their classrooms can communicate what they are learning and what steps they need to take to reach their learning goals, 3) students receive feedback that is descriptive and interactive.

AB  - The demands and expectations placed on all schools in the United States to meet the needs of a growing and diverse population continue to raise the questions, what needs to be done in order for all students to achieve success, and how can this success be measured? This study, researched and reported in the form of a dissertation, was performed on an urban school on the east coast of the United States. The focus of this study was on the aggregate test results of a treatment group (Star School) from a Title 1 school of the Constellation School District consisting of sixty English Language Learner (ELL) students. The specialized instruction provided as a result of item analysis on the district wide Formative Assessment Test scores (FAST) was observed and documented. Additionally, this sample school's results were compared to the other Title 1 schools of that same district consisting of 386 students. Using test scores from Reading Formative Assessments from the years of 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012, the scores of both groups were compared. Also, a review of the research from other studies relative to the practices of this case study were reviewed and reported in support of the findings of this case study. Finally, recommendations and suggestions for curricular enhancements, along with additional teaching strategies, tools, and resources were part of the conclusion of this document. Each should serve as a means of reinforcement to the current practices and as an augmentation to teachers' efficacy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the technical adequacy of progress monitoring assessments in early writing using curriculum-based measurement principles. The participants were 23 students in two first grade classrooms in a small elementary school in a medium sized city in the Midwest. The measures assessed include word copying, word dictation, sentence copying, and sentence dictation. Three minute samples were obtained and analyses were conducted for each minute increment, and were scored using two different methods, correct sequences, and correct minus incorrect sequences. We examined the alternate form reliability of the measures along with the criterion validity of the measures compared to the Test of Early Written Language-2 (TEWL-2), as well as with teacher perceptions of writing proficiency. Examination of the potential of the measures to be sensitive to growth over time was examined after the study’s completion. The results are discussed in terms of technical adequacy, utility of the measures, and ability of the measures to serve as indicators of performance and progress early writing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine six early numeracy measures used to monitor the mathematics progress of kindergarten and first-grade students. Seventy-one kindergarten students and 75 first-grade students were administered the measures each week. Delayed-alternate form reliability was adequate for instructional decision making on some measures, and low reliability was reported for quantity discrimination, as well as for the next number and number facts measures. Concurrent criterion validity coefficients comparing the measures with student performance on the "Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement--Third Edition" (WJ III) resulted in weaker coefficients as compared to previous studies that have compared similar measures with the WJ III. Hierarchical linear modeling was used at each grade level to ascertain the ability of the six measures to model weekly growth trajectories over 13 weeks. All measures produced growth rates that were significant across time, for both kindergarten and first grade, with linear growth observed for all measures. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - The audience response system--technology that allows immediate compilation and display of a group's multiple choice input--is being shown effective in the classroom both in engaging students and providing real time, formative assessment of comprehension. This paper looks at its further potential as an alternative for summative assessment, replacing conventional examinations and testing as a basis for student grades. After brief discussion as to practical benefits of doing so and a review of ARS--hardware, software, and studies of its impact on learning--we develop and report outcomes of two distinct trials utilising ARS for both formative and summative assessment. Results indicate synergies in combining the two forms of assessment, though student attitudes are found to be particularly sensitive to the instructor's approach to design. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - The testing effect arises when learners who are tested rather than relearning material obtain superior scores on a final test than those who relearn. Based on cognitive load theory, six experiments examined whether the effect was evident under low or high element interactivity (a measure of complexity) conditions. Students learning to write types of text were participants. In all experiments, effects on a final common test of two presentations were compared with a single presentation followed by a preliminary test. The testing effect on immediate tests was larger and more likely using lower element interactivity materials. A reverse testing effect was likely on immediate tests tapping higher element interactivity material but possibly eliminated by using a delayed test. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The leading school reform policy in the United States revolves around strong accountability of schools with consequences for performance. The federal government's involvement through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 reinforces the prior movement of many states toward policies based on measured student achievement. Analysis of state achievement growth as measured by the National Assessment of Educational progress shows that accountability systems introduced during the 1990s had a clear positive impact on student achievement. This single policy instrument did not, however, also lead to any narrowing in the Black-White achievement gap (though it did narrow the Hispanic-White achievement gap). Moreover, the Black-White gap appears to have been adversely impacted over the decade by increasing minority concentrations in the schools. An additional issue surrounding stronger accountability has been a concern about unintended outcomes related to such things as higher exclusion rates from testing, increased dropout rates, and the like. Our analysis of special education placement rates, a frequently identified area of concern, does not show any responsiveness to the introduction of accountability systems.

AB  - The systematic learning program developed and implemented at Columbia Heights Elementary School (CHES) in San Antonio (Texas) in 1986-87 and 1987-88 is described. CHES is located in a low socio-economic neighborhood made up of 99% Mexican Americans and was identified as having one of the lowest quartile test scores in the state in 1986. Forty-two percent of the students have been identified as limited English proficient students. The educational program was developed because of the growing demand for educational accountability by the district. The purpose of the program at CHES was to improve learning and instruction while concurrently providing children with test-taking skills. This paper describes the educational program and its effectiveness in raising academic achievement and standardized test scores. Over a 2-year period the program consisted of four project activities: (1) practice test program; (2) tutoring program; (3) weekly activities focused to improve test-taking skills; and (4) inservice teacher education on the writing process, on holistic grading, and on six correlates for effective schools. Results have been positive; test scores on achievement tests have improved significantly over the 2-year period. The campus atmosphere has changed dramatically; and parents, teachers, and administrators have become actively involved in helping children to learn and to succeed. Practice tests of minimum skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, and a campus action plan for grades 1 through 3 are appended. (TJH)

AB  - The Assessment is for Learning programme has been implemented by Learning and Teaching Scotland over recent years and there will be further developments throughout the Scottish curriculum up until and beyond 2007. This article re-examines the techniques of formative assessment that can progress pupil learning and appeals to teachers to review their practice against the background of the research. The purpose of this article is to encourage practitioners in all parts of the UK to embark upon a systematic review of their teaching with regard to formative assessment. In light of the research nationwide practitioners now have a plethora of effective techniques that can be embedded within all aspects of teaching in order to enhance their practice. Teachers may now wish to re-examine their own teaching with a view to exploiting the various strategies and techniques to benefit their pupils.

AB  - This report describes the intervention programs used to improve student proficiency in learning, recalling, and retaining basic mathematics facts. The targeted population consisted of first, second, third, and fifth grades in four suburban midwestern schools. The problems of recalling basic mathematics facts is documented through teacher surveys, parent surveys, student surveys, and scores obtained on timed pretests. Research of probable causes indicated lack of time given to practicing mathematics facts in school, inconsistent at home practice, and little emphasis of mathematics facts within the textbook. This research also indicated an ambivalence among teachers pertaining to the importance of practicing math facts in school. Because the literature review of solutions named pro position, con position, and ambivalent position on teaching basic mathematics facts, the researchers focused on the solutions of the pro position, specifically using music or game interventions daily. Students, parents, and teachers were given surveys to record attitudes about learning mathematics facts. A timed pretest of mathematics facts was administered to experimental and control groups to establish baseline data. Weekly two minute timed tests were given to the experimental groups. A Timed posttest was given to the groups to determine improvement in speed and accuracy. Based on the presentation and analysis of data on mastering basic mathematics facts, the results indicated an increase in the test scores from the pretest to the posttest for the targeted first, second, third, and fifth grade levels. This was true regardless of using the games or music as the intervention. Experimental and control group pretest and posttest scores were also compared. (Contains 50 references.) (Author/MM)

AB  - The levels of use of formative assessment strategies and types of feedback by high school English and mathematics teachers were examined. A non-experimental, quantitative survey approach was used to test whether the levels of use of formative assessment strategies vary by content area taught (English vs. mathematics), teacher's perceptions of their knowledge of these practices, and other teacher demographics (e.g., gender, years of experience, degrees/qualifications). Survey items on formative assessment strategies included specific items from Classroom Assessment for Student Learning Doing It Right -- Using It Well. Feedback survey questions were based on Nyquists' typology of feedback. One-hundred twenty-five surveys were returned by junior-level English and Algebra 2 mathematics teachers, with 106 participants (85%) fully completing the survey. The findings of this study revealed teachers' self-perception of their knowledge of formative assessment practices and participation in professional development activities had a significant association with their level of use of such strategies. In addition, content area taught (English or mathematics) did have a significant association with the type of feedback provided to students most often. Overall, teachers are not always using effective formative assessment strategies during instruction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the relation and predictive validity of the three seventh-grade reading curriculum-based measurements (CBMs), (a) passage reading fluency, (b) vocabulary, and (c) comprehension, on student performance on the Oregon Assessment of Knowledge and Skills Reading (OAKS-R). This question was examined using extant data collected from 857 seventh-grade students in a Pacific Northwest school district during spring quarter. Of the total sample of 857, only 557 students' records were analyzed: 499 general education students and 58 students with learning disabilities who met the a priori participation criteria of having scores on all three spring easyCBM Reading measures (PRF, VOC and MCRC) and an OAKS-R score. Correlational analysis revealed different outcomes for the two groups. For the general education population, the highest correlation coefficient was between CBM vocabulary and OAKS-R (r = .65). Follow-up regression analysis also indicated that CBM Vocabulary (β = .44) was the best predictor for students in the general education population. However, for students with learning disabilities, CBM comprehension was the most strongly correlated to OAKS-R (r = .60), and regression analysis showed comprehension (β = .40) as the best predictor of students' OAKS-R performance. When specific nonacademic variables were added to the regression model for general education, CBM vocabulary (β = .41) and CBM comprehension (β = .43) were still the best predictors for students in general education and students with learning disabilities, respectively. Practical implications of the predictive validity of the CBM reading measures for practitioners are discussed in relation to assessment, instruction, and resource allocations. Finally, suggestions for future research in the areas of improving CBM utility as a predictor of success on statewide assessments in reading at the middle school level are discussed.

AB  - Over the last two decades, there has been renewed interest in formative assessment, in large part due to the increasing pressures and prevalence of "high stakes" summative assessments. As states try to meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind law, teachers and administrators are realizing that formative assessment offers an effective means of increasing student achievement and identifying specific learning gaps. In response to this recognition, many companies and institutions have designed online programs to assess students formatively. However, there has been little empirical research in how teachers use these programs in their planning and instruction, especially in the field of English Language Arts. This study examined how four middle school English Language Arts teachers used information generated by one or more online formative assessment programs to plan and implement reading instruction in their classrooms. The overarching research question for the study was: What is the impact of online formative assessment in reading on teachers' planning and instruction in the middle grades English Language Arts Classroom?

AB  - This article investigates how the timing of quizzes given during learning impacts retention of studied material. We investigated the hypothesis that interspersing quizzes among study blocks increases student engagement, thus improving learning. Participants learned 8 artificial facts about each of 8 plant categories, with the categories blocked during learning. Quizzes about 4 of the 8 facts from each category occurred either immediately after studying the facts for that category (standard) or after studying the facts from all 8 categories (postponed). In Experiment 1, participants were given tests shortly after learning and several days later, including both the initially quizzed and unquizzed facts. Test performance was better in the standard than in the postponed condition, especially for categories learned later in the sequence. This result held even for the facts not quizzed during learning, suggesting that the advantage cannot be due to any direct testing effects. Instead the results support the hypothesis that interrupting learning with quiz questions is beneficial because it can enhance learner engagement. Experiment 2 provided further support for this hypothesis, based on participants’ retrospective ratings of their task engagement during the learning phase. These findings have practical implications for when to introduce quizzes in the classroom. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Definitions of formative assessment include assessment, feedback and differentiated instruction as key components. We investigated the effects of prepared teaching materials designed to support teachers using learning progress assessment (LPA) to give feedback and adapt differentiated instruction. We also examined to what extend this modular approach can be implemented in regular reading lessons in third grade. In a three-group design all teachers (N= 44, N= 945 students) employed a computer-based LPA tool, while teachers in two conditions additionally received prepared feedback material (FB) or feedback and reading instruction material (FB+FM), to support the implementation of the different components of formative assessment. Over the course of one schoolyear, we assessed the implementation outcomes using questionnaires as well as students' reading achievement and further student outcomes. While acceptability is high, teacher ratings of feasibility are low. In comparison to the LPA group, the additional support in form of prepared materials had no effects on student outcomes. Results are discussed regarding the question of how teachers can optimally be supported in using formative assessment.

AB  - 12 mentally defective schoolboys between the ages of 14 and 16 years took the AH4 test 10 times without knowledge of results, at weekly intervals and the Progressive Matrices about 30 days following the last test period. They tended to improve throughout the 10 testings. The scores on Part II (diagrammatic) started at a higher level and showed more improvement than Part I (verbal and numerical). The relatively high Progressive Matrices scores indicate some practice effect produced by repeatedly taking a different test. The differences between the mental defectives and a normal group of intelligent adults were: (1) individually the defectives were more erratic and unpredictable, (2) they also found Part II easier than Part I, (3) the retarded group was less consistent in their errors and correct answers.

AB  - We examine how students’ physiological stress differs between a regular school week and a high-stakes testing week, and we raise questions about how to interpret high-stakes test scores. A potential contributor to socioeconomic disparities in academic performance
is the difference in the level of stress experienced by students outside of school. Chronic stress—due to neighborhood violence, poverty, or family instability—can affect how individuals’ bodies respond to stressors in general, including the stress of standardized testing. This, in turn, can affect whether performance on standardized tests is a valid measure of students’ actual  ability. We collect data on students’ stress responses using cortisol samples provided by low-income students in New Orleans.We measure how their cortisol patterns change during high-stakes testing weeks relative to baseline weeks. We find that high-stakes testing is related to cortisol responses, and those responses are related to test performance. Those who responded most strongly, with either increases or decreases in cortisol, scored 0.40 standard
deviations lower than expected on the high-stakes exam.

AB  - Over the years, teachers, administrators, and policy makers have been concerned with optimizing learning for all students. The No Child Left Behind Act put an emphasis on summative assessments, which measure what students have learned. In contrast, formative assessment has been shown in many studies to improve student achievement and motivation because it is applied while students are learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate, for middle and high school mathematics and science instruction, the validity and reliability of a newly developed observation instrument called AssessToday, which is used in a single class period to assess a teacher’s use of short-cycle formative assessment. The content validity of the instrument was supported through an extensive literature review, feedback from experts in the field of formative assessment, and an examination of 98 classroom observations. For assessing reliability of the instrument, inter-rater reliability coefficients were calculated using data collected by trained observers who independently rated teachers during the same class period using three measures: percentage of agreement between raters, Cohen’s kappa, and Fleiss kappa. Cohen’s kappa (N = 36 pairs) ranged from .62 to 1.00 for all observer pairs with an average kappa of .75 for mathematics (n = 16 pairs) and .76 for science (n = 20 pairs). The recommended threshold for kappa is k = .70. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the observation data and the determined factors related to the theoretical framework established in the literature. The results affirmed that the instrument is a tool to be utilized in short-cycle formative assessment with middle and high school science and mathematics teachers.

AB  - This study used data analysis of Missouri state assessments in communication arts and grade level reading equivalents from a normed reading assessment as a basis for determining if intervention instruction informed by formative assessment improved reading proficiency and student achievement for grades 3-5 in a small and rural school setting. The data were collected over a four year period on the communication arts section of the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) tests and the Standardized Test of the Assessment of Reading (STAR) grade level reading equivalents. The researcher investigated the application of Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) data as a factor for determining the interventions and instruction. The researcher also investigated teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of DIBELS formative assessment to improve reading proficiency and teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of DIBELS training and professional development to improve reading intervention instruction. The results of the study found that intervention instruction had a positive impact on student achievement and on reading skill acquisition. MAP pre-test percentile means were significantly less than the MAP post-test percentile means indicating a 3.26 percentile score increase. STAR pre-test means were significantly less the STAR post-test means indicating a 1.642 increase in the grade level equivalent. The researcher also concluded that teacher perceptions of data informed intervention instruction positively influenced classroom instruction and student achievement. Additionally, consistent and continuous professional development was very important to the strength of intervention instruction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the United States has been concerned with competing globally in science and mathematics. In 1958, the National Defense Education Act was passed to raise national academic achievement. Since 1969, to ensure students were performing at acceptable levels, Basic-Skills and End Of Course (EOC) tests have been employed in schools in most states. District and campus accountability, student promotion, and funding are often tied to student performance on these tests. Since 2012,the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) has been the assessment for Texas. Concerned with improving STAAR performance, many teachers administer frequent formative exams as a means of increasing student familiarity with subject matter and testing techniques. Some researchers have suggested means by which formative assessment effectiveness might be enhanced. However, a gap in the literature was found concerning formative assessment effectiveness relative to the number of tests given. The current study intended to fill that gap. Utilizing historical data on common formative assessments (CFA) and campus scores on the 2016-2017 fourth grade mathematics STAAR, this study employed a one-way between subjects ANOVA to determine the relationship between student performance and increments of formative assessments administered. Clusters of five to eight, nine to 14, and 15 or more formative assessments administered prior to the STAAR were examined. The findings of the current study showed that the number of CFAs administered did not influence student performance, either at the campus level or across campuses in one north Texas independent school district. All campuses in the current study met the STAAR passing standard, regardless of the number of CFAs that were administered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Based on the results of a generalizability study (G study) of measures of teacher knowledge for teaching mathematics developed at The National Center for Research, on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) at the University of California, Los Angeles, this report provides evidence that teachers are better at drawing reasonable inferences about student levels of understanding from assessment information than they are in deciding the next instructional steps. We discuss the implications of the results for effective formative assessment and end with considerations of how teachers can be supported to know what to teach next.

AB  - This article articulates a framework for examining the quality of formative assessment practice and provides empirical evidence in support of one of its components. Based on a study of middle school science, the study examines the accuracy of teachers' judgments of students' understanding and the relationship of such accuracy to middle school students' learning. Analyses within and between teachers show a consistent, positive relationship between teacher accuracy and student learning. Study results lend support for the power of assessment in improving student learning and also suggest some potential challenges in assuring quality formative assessment practice.

AB  - With support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, researchers and experts in mathematics education developed the Mathematics Design Collaborative (MDC) as a strategy to support the transition to Common Core State Standards in math. MDC provides short formative assessment lessons known as Classroom Challenges for use in middle and high school math classrooms. UCLA CRESST's study of ninth-grade Algebra 1 classrooms in Kentucky implementing MDC showed strong support from teachers for the intervention and a statistically significant positive impact on student scores on the PLAN Algebra assessment, as compared to similar students statewide in Kentucky. The following are appended: (1) MDC Instruments and Rubrics, (2) MDC Teacher Log Descriptives; (3) MDC Teacher Survey Descriptives; (4) Analysis of MDC Student Work Artifacts; and (5) Quasi-Experimental Analysis of MDC Effects.

AB  - This exploratory study of elementary school science examines questions central to policy, practice and research on formative assessment: What is the quality of teachers’ content-pedagogical and assessment knowledge? What is the relationship between teacher knowledge and assessment practice? What is the relationship between teacher knowledge, assessment practice and student learning? Drawing on multiple measures, hierarchical linear modelling and path analysis, results suggest that despite weaknesses in teachers’ content-pedagogical and assessment knowledge, teachers’ formative assessment practices are positively related to student learning. Relationships between teachers’ knowledge and assessment practices are mixed. Findings underscore both the potential and challenge of bringing effective formative practice to fruition as well as the need for continued research.

AB  - Colorado's 2009 Education Accountability law dictates that schools failing to demonstrate expected student outcomes for five consecutive years may face sanctions that include school closure, chartering, privatization, and the firing of school personnel. District turnaround policy makers are tasked to identify the most effective improvement strategies. Research on the use of interim assessment to increase student outcomes has been inconclusive regarding whether implementation costs are worth the benefit. Policy makers have continued to implement interim assessment as part of school improvement in schools identified as priority improvement and turnaround without research to guide practice. Using Production Function Theory as a conceptual framework, this quantitative, quasi-experimental study included 23 priority improvement and turnaround schools that used interim assessment as part of school improvement from 2011--2014. The study was used to determine the extent to which IA implementation positively affected student growth percentiles in the areas of reading and math. For reading, the findings were a statistically significant increase in mean MGP with a moderate effect size. For math, the findings were an increase in mean MGP that was not statistically significant with a small effect size. Two conclusions were drawn from these findings: (1) the use of interim assessment to support improved reading instruction is justifiable for policy makers seeking to support strategies for increasing student growth in reading and (2) policy makers should conduct a 'health check' on foundational areas of math instruction prior to math interim assessment implementation. Three recommendations for future research are (1) a quantitative study focused on student growth percentiles for historically disadvantaged groups of students to determine if the use of interim assessment supported closing the achievement gap, (2) a qualitative study focused on the use data literacy to support policy makers in determining appropriate foundational support and training prior to deploying interim assessment within school improvement strategy, and (3) mixed methods research to first identify which interim assessments are utilized in turnaround schools that show increased growth and second, to study teacher perception of these tools in relation to increases in student growth.

AB  - Six fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms of children were involved in three studies undertaken to measure the effectiveness of four sets of teaching behaviors on short-term student achievement gains. The following behaviors were considered: (1) sharing instructional objectives with students; (2) providing feedback emphasizing students' abilities; (3) conducting daily reviews for the purpose of relating the concepts and principles taught during the lesson; and (4) using formative quizzes to identify learning difficulties and follow up with appropriate corrective procedures. The research examined the effects of these procedures on the achievement of students in three subject areas: literature, social studies, and mathematics. Examination of the data and analysis of achievement scores in the various classes indicate that the use of instructional objectives, lesson reviews, ability praise, formative testing, and correctives are important instructional procedures and are related to student achievement.

AB  - E-assessment is the process where technologies are used for the management of the end-to-end assessment process. It involves the use of any technology-based method that allows systematic inferences and judgments to be made about the student's skills, knowledge and capabilities acquisition. In online learning, technology is used to facilitate the implementation of the appropriate models that can be used for both teaching and learning. In addition, e-assessment technologies allow creating tools able to improve student engagement and performance, offer possibilities to practice competences and skills, provide personalized feedback and improve student motivation. This paper presents a general e-assessment tool with a formative e-assessment model. The e-assessment tool under a formative assessment model is integrated into the learning process and provides aligned and authentic learning experience, focused on skill and knowledge acquisition. Results show that the e-assessment tool and its model had a positive effect on students' performance and learning. The tool itself is capable of providing students with personalized feedback, guidance and marks as well as automatically storing and tracking students' progress, competences and outcomes, going beyond the e-assessment approach based mainly on quizzes. The e-assessment tool and model offer innovative assessment approaches, mainly focusing on skill assessment where dynamic and interactive questions were provided with the guidance of personalized feedback and hints.

AB  - The GenScope Assessment Project is studying assessment in the context of a month-long computer-supported learning environment for introductory genetics. Across three annual iterations with multiple teachers, project researchers manipulated the materials, incentives, and contexts in which students were invited to use formative feedback on challenging classroom performance assessments. The consequences of these manipulations on engagement and learning were systematically examined from behavioral/empiricist, cognitive/rationalist, and situative/sociohistoric perspectives. This "comparative approach" was intended to provide new insights into unresolved issues over extrinsic rewards and accountability-oriented reforms.It turned out that the comparative approach also provided a powerful framework for refining and improving theories about classroom assessment. Essentially researchers "tuned" the classroom assessment environment to maximize gains on carefully aligned external performance assessments. Successive improvements led to correspondingly larger gains on an external achievement test that was more aligned with conventional genetics instruction. This study shows that design-based research around classroom assessment can help meet the wider educational goals of researchers within the increasingly narrow policies of reformers. Five appendixes contain examples of feedback and rubrics. (Contains 10 figures and 80 references.) (SLD)

AB  - An assessment-oriented design-based research model was applied to existing inquiry-oriented multimedia programs in astronomy, biology, and ecology. Building on emerging situative theories of assessment, the model extends prevailing views of formative assessment "for" learning by embedding "discursive" formative assessment more directly into the curriculum. Three twenty-hour curricula were designed and aligned to content standards, and three levels of assessments were developed and used to assess and enhance learning for each curriculum. These assessments included three or four informal "activity-oriented" quizzes and discursive formative feedback rubrics supporting collective discourse, a "curriculum-oriented" examination of individual conceptual understanding, and a "standards-oriented" test measuring aggregated achievement of targeted standards. After two design-research cycles, worthwhile scientific argumentation and statistically significant gains were attained for two of the three packages on the exam and test. Achievement gains were comparable to or larger than those of students in comparison classrooms. Many existing innovations could be enhanced and evaluated in this fashion; designing these strategies directly into innovations could have an even greater impact on discourse, understanding, and achievement.

AB  - This study examined the effect of progress monitoring frequency and scoring metric on curriculum-based measurement of written expression (CBM-WE) progress monitoring estimates. The writing progress of 116 second-grade students receiving a classwide writing fluency intervention in their general education classrooms was monitored across 13 weeks (i.e., 1 week of baseline and 12 weeks during the intervention) using CBM-WE. The writing samples were scored for total words written, words spelled correctly, correct writing sequences, and correct minus incorrect writing sequences. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that progress monitoring frequency (weekly, bimonthly, monthly, or every 6 weeks) had a small effect on intercept and slope but a moderate effect on standard error of the estimate ("SEE") and standard error of the slope ("SEb"). Scoring metric had a moderate effect on intercept but a small effect on slope, "SEE," and "SEb." Students' intercepts were not related to their slopes across any scoring metrics. Overall, the results of this study suggest that monitoring students' writing progress every 6 weeks may reduce error while preserving their intercept and slope estimates.

AB  - This dissertation presents three studies that were designed to examine formative assessment from a sociocultural perspective. The first study presents the development, inter-rater reliability, and use of the Formative Assessment and Interaction Record (FAIR), which is a measure for documenting teachers' use of formative assessment and additional research-based instructional strategies. The FAIR was created to serve several interrelated purposes: (a) to document teachers' strategy use, (b) to allow teachers and schools to set specific goals for changes in instruction and to provide a means to document those changes, (c) to provide a tool for principals to use in their efforts to develop professional learning communities focused on equity in achievement, and (d) to encourage collaborative reflection and dialogue that is focused on the use of research-based strategies as a means to extend students' opportunities to learn. The goal of this study was to construct a reliable tool that could support district administrators and site principals in their collaborative efforts to increase teachers' use of formative assessment and equity-focused strategies. The second study is a qualitative investigation of collaboration between site and district leaders to engage teachers in inquiry and analysis of teacher performance data and student assessment results, with a focus on formative assessment practices and their relationship to equity and opportunity to learn. Interviews were conducted with principals from six elementary schools in a district serving a diverse student population with 49% socioeconomically disadvantaged students and 38% English learners. Results describe: how principals used teacher performance data to increase teachers' use of research-based formative assessment practices, the means by which principals facilitated the formative use of assessment data through teacher inquiry, and principals' perceptions of how this work relates to their goals of increasing achievement, equity, and opportunity to learn. The final investigation is a case study of teacher-student dialogue in the context of a whole-class peer assessment activity to demonstrate how such formative assessment activities support the use of dialogic instruction. While numerous studies have documented the positive effects of dialogic instruction on student learning, little is known about the variety of classroom contexts that might prove more or less conducive to dialogic instruction. The research question addressed in this study was: Can formative assessment support a dialogic lesson structure? It was hypothesized that teacher-student interactions in the context of student assessment would include authentic, high-level teacher questions, high-level teacher responsiveness, a substantial proportion of time devoted to discussion, broad participation by students, and longer student responses than what is commonly associated with typical teacher-student dialogue. Results indicated that the whole-class peer assessment activity was consistent with features of dialogic instruction.

AB  - Students with intellectual disability (ID) have continued to struggle with reading achievement despite recent accountability measures and high academic expectations for all students. Several researchers have started to explore the use of phonics based reading interventions with students with ID and the results are promising. The purpose of this study was to extend the previous research on phonics based reading interventions by examining the effects of teachers’ use of reading curriculum based measurement (CBM) combined with student consultation and goal setting on related student reading outcomes and amount of provided daily reading instruction. Teachers were trained to administer CBM and also learned to interpret CBM data so they could monitor reading goals and make appropriate instructional changes for participating students. Three teachers administered weekly CBM to four eligible students with ID and monitored data for 16 consecutive weeks. Participating teachers consulted with each participating student weekly to share previous CBM scores, provide encouragement and to highlight weekly reading goals. A multiple baseline across participants design was used to display and interpret visual data. Findings revealed that all four students increased his or her weekly reading fluency and accuracy but there was no functional relation established between intervention and improved reading across students. However, weekly minutes of reading instruction increased during intervention for three of the four students. Directions for future research are discussed, as are limitations and implications for practitioners. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to extend previous research on the use of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) for students with intellectual disability by having 19 special education teachers monitor weekly reading progress of 38 students with intellectual disability for approximately 15 weeks and examining whether students exhibited gains on the progress monitoring measures. In addition to the weekly CBM, teachers reported the type and duration of daily reading instruction. Data were analyzed to explore relationships between CBM performance and reading instruction. Our results indicate that teachers are capable of administering and scoring CBM on a weekly basis and that CBM does capture reading growth for some students with intellectual disability. Correlations between CBM performance and a teacher report of skills taught during reading instruction indicate that teachers may be differentiating instruction based on students' reading ability. Directions for future research as well as limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the possible impact that incorporating daily metacognitive questioning in a mathematics classroom could have on student achievement. The study integrated metacognition into the classroom through the daily use of metacognitive questioning sheets that were answered by students who participated in the research study. The study also explored patterns that emerged from the students' individual responses on the metacognitive sheets using qualitative coding and analyses. Two classes of heterogeneously grouped high school dual-credit college algebra students were taught the same curriculum by the same teacher and given the same summative assessments during the study. One class received the metacognitive questioning sheets daily for two units, and one class received the questioning sheets for only one unit. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the two classes on one of the summative assessments at the conclusion of the study. Analyzing the individual students' metacognitive sheets revealed common patterns among the students such as self-assessing during learning, self-confidence in their learning, and transparency about their misunderstandings and lack of knowledge. While there may not have been a significant difference among the students' scores in each of the two classes using an ANOVA and paired samples t-tests, there was still evidence that students' thinking and clearly describing where they were in their own learning had a positive impact on their achievement.

AB  - This study examined the diagnostic accuracy associated with decision making as is typically conducted with curriculum-based measurement (CBM) approaches to progress monitoring. Using previously published estimates of the standard errors of estimate associated with CBM, 20,000 progress-monitoring data sets were simulated to model student reading growth of two-word increase per week across 15 consecutive weeks. Results indicated that an unacceptably high proportion of cases were falsely identified as nonresponsive to intervention when a common 4-point decision rule was applied, under the context of typical levels of probe reliability. As reliability and stringency of the decision-making rule increased, such errors decreased. Findings are particularly relevant to those who use a multi-tiered response-to-intervention model for evaluating formative changes associated with instructional intervention and evaluating responsiveness to intervention across multiple tiers of intervention.

AB  - To expand and improve evidence of grading practices, we seized an opportunity presented by the implementation of standards-based grading practices at 11 high schools in Jefferson County Public Schools in Louisville, Ky. These high-needs schools faced substantial sanctions outlined by recently revised federal and state policies unless they made substantial improvements in state standardized test results. To dramatically increase the number of students meeting proficiency benchmarks, principals and teachers from the 11 high schools collaborated with district personnel to establish a competency-based instructional initiative. The teamwork between school and district-based educators resulted in Project Proficiency. For each grading period, Project Proficiency required teachers to focus on three key standards per grading period. School and district-based content specialists derived these 18 standards from the content of the state algebra curriculum. Teachers created formative assessments that measured student progress in each standard. If a student did not demonstrate competency, teachers developed interventions that focused specifically on the student's identified needs. Finally, schools participating in Project Proficiency adopted testing procedures that supported reassessment of students until they reached proficiency. Compared to traditional grading, standards-based grading practices demonstrated stronger correlations between grades and standardized test scores, including among minority and economically disadvantaged students. In addition, students who experienced standards-based grading more often earned an A or B and scored higher on the standardized state test. Although we discovered statistical benefits to standards-based grading practices, we wondered how these differences translated into real students, grades, and test results.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to empirically evaluate the effects of the Math to Mastery intervention package versus the effects of immediate corrective feedback with elementary school students who were performing at least one year below grade level in mathematics. Students were participants in a one-month summer academic clinic for remediation of reading, writing, and mathematics deficits held at a university in the southeastern United States. A combined-series multiple baseline design across participants was used to evaluate the effects of both interventions for gains in fluency as measured by digits correct per minute on one minute curriculum-based measurement probes. Implications for implementation in applied settings and future research are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - These days, a growing chorus of parents, educators, and policymakers is voicing frustration and anger with top-down accountability and high-stakes testing. As members of two not-for-profit education organizations--one focused on assessment and the other on research and instructional practices--the authors find nothing wrong with testing itself; indeed, they believe evidence of what students know and can do should be at the heart of schooling. They are concerned, however, about what seems to be an almost myopic focus on high-stakes accountability based on tests of basic knowledge and skills to drive improvements in educational outcomes, to the exclusion of using formative and performance assessment to facilitate student growth and deeper learning (i.e., the ability to apply knowledge and skills in novel situations) (Pelligrino & Hilton, 2012). Thus, they call for replacing our current, unbalanced formula of summative assessments and external pressure with a new, more balanced formula for assessment and accountability centered around "curriculum-embedded performance assessments" or "CEPAs"--classroom-based instructional units that provide multiple opportunities for learning and both formative and summative evidence-gathering. Done well, CEPAs can harness the power of real-time feedback, personalized learning, and real-world application to help students develop requisite foundational knowledge and deeper learning. Moreover, as the authors will discuss, CEPAs may be used for summative, including state accountability, purposes. While they are not a silver bullet, CEPAs could drive many other beneficial changes in the education system, including better classroom practice, more motivating and engaging school environments, and greater professional collaboration among educators. Perhaps most promising, CEPAs could undergird a state-level accountability system that measures what matters most: the extent to which students are developing and demonstrating the kinds of deeper learning they will need for success in college, career, and life.

AB  - Standardized norm-referenced tests have dominated the field of educational assessment for years. Many educators recognized, though, that standardized norm-referenced tests lacked adequate psychometric characteristics and also lacked instructional relevance. In order to deal with these inadequacies, educators developed curriculum-based assessment as an alternative to standardized, norm-referenced tests. In curriculum-based assessment, teachers observe and record student performance in the local curriculum. Research revealed that the use of curriculum-based assessment led to improvements in student academic performance and teacher instructional behavior. However, curriculum-based assessment is a complex process and consists of a variety of components, such as the provision of feedback to students and teachers and the provision of remediation recommendations to teachers. Any one or group of components might influence students and teachers to change their behavior. The purpose of the present study was to determine the influence of five components of curriculum-based assessment on student academic performance and on teacher instructional behavior. In a multiple-baseline design across groups of subjects, the researcher in the present study sequentially administered each of five components of curriculum-based assessment to groups of two or three students. Although the participating teachers claimed that their understanding of their students' academic difficulties improved, none of the components had consistent positive effects on students' or teachers' behaviors. Varying levels of motivation of the subjects inhibited improvements in student and teacher behaviors. Other problems encountered in the study, such as distinguishing practice and motivation effects from the effects of components and assessing reading comprehension accurately, frequently prevented the determination of the effects of the components of curriculum-based assessment on the dependent measures. In spite of the problems encountered in this study, certain components of curriculum-based assessment did exert some influence on the academic performance of some students and the instructional behavior of the teachers. Whether any component can be a powerful independent variable with noticeable influence on a variety of behaviors of many students and teachers is an issue for future research.

AB  - An increased emphasis on data-based decision making has resulted in pressures on educational institutions to find new and innovative ways to reach and assess students at younger and younger ages. At the preschool level progress-monitoring tools are being utilized to inform instruction and intervention, and ideally, improving student outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of progress monitoring, both with and without the addition of a consultation model on student performance as measure by the Individual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDIs) with preschool aged students. Research questions, including: To what extent does the administration of the IGDIs measures as progress monitoring tools alone have an effect on student achievement both with and without consultation, and how does disability status moderate these findings are addressed. Additionally, this study intended to qualitatively assess teacher pedagogy as a function of progress-monitoring. Participants were 150 preschool students, ages 3-5, enrolled in either urban or suburban early childhood education programs including Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE), Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE), YMCA preschool, High Fives, YWCA preschool, school readiness or private preschool. ANOVA, Hierarchical Multivariate Linear Modeling (HMLM) and effect size analyses were used to examine the relationship between progress monitoring (both with and without consultation) and student performance. Results suggest progress monitoring as an intervention resulted in positive effects on student achievement compared to Control, while progress monitoring with the addition of a behavioral consultation model produced positive effects on student achievement compared to Control, but not above and beyond the effects of progress monitoring alone. When these results were further examined by disability status, results indicated mixed findings suggesting future studies investigating progress monitoring with students with disabilities is warranted. Implications for best practice, merits and limitations and directions for future research are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Older student reading of informational texts like those found in most high school classrooms continue to be a concern. College entrance exams scores attest to the fact that this age group of readers remain largely unprepared for the rigorous, discipline area reading and comprehension demands of higher education. In response to this issue content area teachers have been encouraged to teach reading skills for their subject matter. Standard reading instruction tools have included reading guides and summative reading assessments. This study sought to compare the effects of standard reading pedagogy with computerized, formative reading assessments given to students as they read. The largest publisher of high school textbooks, Pearson Prentice-Hall, and the publisher of the high school government text used in this study currently does not have in place digital, formative reading assessments tracking section by chapter section. High school seniors in nine sections of American Government under two different instructors participated in this mixed method, quasiexperimental study. Results indicate a significant difference in content comprehension with the formative assessment pedagogy. Survey and questionnaire responses suggest students thought they read better and were more motivated to read responding to computerized formative assessments (CBA's) that closely tracked their subject matter textbooks.

AB  - The National Union of Students (NUS) National Student Experience Report identified examination feedback as an area where students had particular concerns. This finding was echoed in the authors' institution and triggered an action research project to investigate ways of improving students' perceptions of pre- and post-exam feedback. We report the results of part of the project aimed at improving student satisfaction with pre-exam feedback and preparedness for the end of module examination, where we used an "Assessment for Learning" (AfL) strategy. Students on a second year human genetics module (LSC-20050) were supplied with a series of 10 formative online tests with instant feedback. Our results show that students who completed more of the online tests performed significantly better in the end of module exam than students who completed less than 4 tests. Comparing the LSC-20050 exam results with other bioscience modules indicates that the students who took fewer tests did no better in LSC-20050, but the students who did more tests showed significantly enhanced performance in LSC-20050. Students who did the tests reported that they found the tests a useful way to learn and felt better prepared for the exam. Thus, engagement with online assessments can improve pre-exam feedback satisfaction with the added bonus of improving exam performance. (Contains 2 tables and 6 figures.)

AB  - This study examined the effects of repeated testing in an Introductory Psychology course. Student performance on items repeated from quizzes to exams (either unit, cumulative, or both) was compared to items that had not been previously administered. In addition, we examined unit and cumulative exam performance by the format of quiz items (multiple-choice, short-answer, or summary study items) to examine differences resulting from original format. We found that prior exposure to, not prior testing of, items was beneficial for enhanced performance on later assessments. Although students performed better on multiple-choice quiz questions, there were no differences in performance for repeated multiple-choice, repeated short-answer, or study items on either unit or cumulative exams. We performed a series of regression analyses on four individual difference variables: aptitude, academic achievement, learning strategies, and study skills. Academic achievement was the single best predictor for the benefit of testing.

AB  - To achieve academic success in English speaking higher education, English proficiency is key (Trenkic & Warmington, 2018). However, IELTS - a standardised test of English proficiency frequently used as a university entry requirement - has been reported an inconsistent predictor (e.g. Feast, 2002; Dooey & Oliver, 2002; Woodrow, 2006). Here, two quasi-experiments were conducted to explored potential reasons behind this inconsistency. Using a pretest/intervention/posttest design, quasi-experiment 1 investigated whether IELTS test-preparation programmes can boost IELTS scores beyond test takers' actual levels of proficiency (N=89). In the intervention group, a significant boost in IELTS scores from pre-test to post-test was found but there was no significant improvement in general proficiency, measured through another standardised proficiency test, a vocabulary test, and a processing accuracy/speed test. In the control group, no difference in results on either IELTS or the other three measures. Quasi-experiment 2 first examined whether repeated test-taking may boost IELTS scores beyond test-takers' actual proficiency levels and then explored the predictive validity of IELTS on academic attainment among 153 Chinese students at a UK university. Results indicated that repeated test-taking inflated IELTS scores beyond the level of proficiency, but only marginally. IELTS was significantly correlated with academic grades for students from both linguistically more and less disciplines. Moreover, IELTS was found to be a good predictor for grades for the linguistically more demanding. In short, IELTS scores can be boosted beyond one's actual proficiency by attending dedicated test-preparation courses and to a lesser extent by taking the test repeatedly. Hence students admitted on the premises of a certain IELTS may in fact be of lower proficiency. This discrepancy can impact their academic achievement. This study offers insights as to why prior research on the relationship between IELTS scores and academic attainment yielded inconsistent findings and considers theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between metacognitive skills occurring during journaling in process reading and reading comprehension and the motivation to read. The researcher investigated metacognitive skills developed through journaling (measured by rubrics to score journals) and correlated them with standardized measures of comprehension (Gates MacGinitie Comprehension Test) and motivation to read (The Elementary Reading Attitude Study). Using a pre test and post test model, the researcher tested the sample group in the areas of reading comprehension and reading motivation before and after a twelve week study in which the sample population was instructed in the process reading approach to reading instruction. Twelve journaling questions were scored weekly using a rubric created by the researcher to evaluate metacognitive responses. Two fifth grade elementary classrooms participated in this study from February, 1996 to May, 1996. A small town elementary school, with a total population of 702 students in grades kindergarten through sixth, was used as the source of subjects. Two intact classrooms of children were studied in one school building so that the method of instruction was as uniform as possible within the framework of one study. Descriptive statistics were presented and t tests of correlated samples were conducted to determine if there were any significant differences between pre test and post test scores of both the reading comprehension and reading motivation tests. Time series (secular trend) analysis was conducted on the mean performances of metacognition evaluations using the scoring rubric. Partial correlation coefficients between metacognition, comprehension, and the motivation to read were calculated to determine if there were any statistically significant relationships between any two reading variables, holding the third constant, within each weekly evaluation period. Reading comprehension was found to increase over the (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative quasi-experimental research was to determine if using data proven strategies, specifically in the areas of reading and writing instruction, would impact reading comprehension achievement in students in grades 3-7 in small, multi-grade classrooms. The research was based on a convenience study that involved 17 students, two classroom teachers and one principal, in a single multi-grade private school setting, in a state located in the eastern region of the United States. During the 2018-19 school year, students were given the Fall Iowa Assessment and the Spring Iowa Assessment. The study implemented a repeated measure design, using paired samples t-tests to determine difference in scores and significance of growth. Data were evaluated to determine the change between pretests and posttests of six subtests from the Iowa Assessment. Analysis of data indicated that all subtests, except for Written Expression, showed statistically significant difference in growth, and thus showed an increase in achievement results.

AB  - Flipped classrooms continue to grow in popularity across all levels of education. Following this pedagogical trend, the present study aimed to enhance the face-to-face instruction in flipped classrooms with the use of clickers. A game-like clicker application was implemented through a bring your own device (BYOD) model to gamify classroom dynamics in the spirit of question-and-answer competitions. A series of flipped learning lessons were created for the study, with clickers integrated into question-and-answer activities associated with each of the lessons as formative assessments to assist students in the learning of English as a foreign language. In this quasi-experimental research, the data were gathered using a summative assessment, a perception survey, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analyzed to compare the students' flipped learning experiences, with or without clicker use. The results indicated that the gamified use of clickers had positive influences on student learning, with regard to their performance, perceptions, and preferences. This study thus suggests that the emerging generation of clicker technology allows for a cost-effective BYOD integration model in flipped classrooms, through which it is possible to seamlessly bridge pre-class and in-class activities and to effectively promote student learning.

AB  - The advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies has encouraged an increasing number of studies concerning mobile learning, in which students are able to learn via mobile devices without being limited by space and time; in particular, the students can be situated in a real-world scenario associated with the learning content. Although such an approach seems interesting to the students, researchers have emphasized the need for well-designed learning support in order to improve the students’ learning achievements. Therefore, it has become an important issue to develop methodologies or tools to assist the students to learn in a mobile learning environment. Based on this perspective, this study proposes a formative assessment-based approach for improving the learning achievements of students in a mobile learning environment. A mobile learning environment has been developed based on this approach, and an experiment on a local culture course has been conducted in southern Taiwan to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only promotes the students’ learning interest and attitude, but also improves their learning achievement.

AB  - Ubiquitous geometry (UG) system that was designed and developed for the sixth-grade school students to learn geometry through measuring geometric objects surrounding them is presented. Real geometric objects could facilitate and consolidate students' geometric learning if students were given an opportunity to apply and practice geometric concept-related theories with their daily life objects. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was an attempt to improve students' interest and learning in geometry by providing the proposed UG system in tablet computers to measure daily life objects. Furthermore, two activities, namely, peer assessment and competition, were also designed to facilitate students' interaction and learning. Based on the results of one of the experiments, it is found that students' learning motivation and achievement have been improved significantly. Further, results of the pair t-test applied for pretest and posttest data show that students' geometry learning performances have been improved significantly by using the UG system. Regarding the involvement of students in the proposed activities, it was found that the amounts of competition records, reviewing own competition records, and the highest score of competition were significantly correlated with students' learning gains. The reasons behind were further investigated and found that it can help students to find their own mistakes and clarify misconceptions by doing and reviewing their own competition records. Therefore, it is clear that the proposed UG system and competition activities in this study can help the students to learn geometry better in comparison to traditional learning.

AB  - Efforts are being made to add Computational Thinking (CT) to the curriculum of primary schools in order to develop student abilities to use computational tools to solve problems and better prepare them for an increasingly digital society. Distributed Practice (DP) and Retrieval Practice (RP) are evidence-based practices that have shown to lead to efficient and durable learning. Studies investigating Distributed Retrieval Practice (DRP), a combination of the two evidence-based practices, have found positive effects of DRP on university student learning of anatomy and vocabulary items. As CT is considered to be a complex thinking skill, one that is acquired over time with practice, we investigated whether DRP had durable effects on primary student learning of CT concepts. We conducted a quasi-experimental study involving 20 primary school students between 11 and 12 years of age. The students participated in 6 weekly sessions on CT and completed two tests -- one at the end of the fifth session (immediate) and the other a week later (delayed). At the end of each of the first 4 sessions, students performed DRP by completing a class-wide review quiz consisting of 5 multiple-choice questions. The results of the study show that students attained higher scores on the delayed test (72.6% ± 19.2) in comparison to the immediate test (67.9% ± 20.7). However, the difference in scores was not significant. The results suggest that DRP may play a role in helping students overcome the natural decay of memory, however, studies with a larger sample size are required. Further, this study demonstrates that DRP can be applied in an authentic classroom environment that involves primary school student learning of a complex subject such as CT.

AB  - Studied reasons for why many high school students experience serious learning difficulties in physics in the context of an introductory (9th grade) physics course offered in Israeli high schools. Following a detailed task analysis, the cognitive entry requirements for the course were identified, and students were tested for them. Specific difficulties students encountered during the course and prevailing misconceptions were identified. Based on this information, a remedial teaching method was developed. It consisted of supplying students with immediate and frequent feedback to reinforce their understanding, correct misunderstandings, and fill in gaps in background skills, while teachers continuously monitored the progress of each student. The process took place within the natural classroom setting, without additional staff or time requirements. The method was implemented in a large number of schools, and its impact was assessed using an experimental vs control ANCOVA design. Achievement of the experimental group (38 students) was significantly higher than that of the control group (48 students). The statistical analysis used students' background as the covariate. Of the 47% of the variance that the model accounted for, 24% was explained by the covariate (background) and 16% by the effect of the treatment; both were highly significant. An additional 7% was the teachers' effect (nested within treatments), but this effect did not reach significance. (24 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purposes of this study were (1) to examine the direct and indirect effect of school-level testing policies on reading achievement though changes in amount and types of reading instruction, (2) to investigate the reading trajectories moderated by school-level testing policies longitudinally, and (3) to examine the relationship between testing policies and the achievement gap by exploring whether certain student characteristics moderate the relationship between testing policy and reading achievement, using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten (ECLS-K) Cohort of 2010-2011 data. Findings from a multilevel full structural mediation model suggest that school-level frequency of state/local standardized tests had an indirect effect on student reading achievement through changes in both amount and the types of instruction at the school-level (cross-sectional fall kindergarten sample =12,241 children nested in 1,067 kindergarten classes). The findings from a three-level growth models indicated only children of Asian background and children from high socio-economic backgrounds who had frequent standardized tests in kindergarten accelerated in their monthly reading growth, whereas other children (e.g., low SES, non-Asian children) did not show any changes in the rate of the reading growth (longitudinal sample from fall of kindergarten to spring of first grade = 7,392 children nested in 744 kindergartens). The findings from the current study suggest that testing policy is not an effective means to reduce the achievement gap of children from disadvantaged family backgrounds, underperforming children or that children from low socieo-economic backgrounds. These children did not seem to benefit from frequent standardized tests longitudinally. Implications for supporting school assessment practices and instruction are discussed.

AB  - Drawing from data use theory (i.e., a theory for making data-driven educational decisions), the present study sought to understand how frequency of standardized testing is related to student learning, mediated by reading instruction, after controlling for child-level (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) and school-level covariates (e.g., private/public, proportion of students eligible for free lunch). Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort of 2010–2011, the sample included 12,241 children attending 1067 kindergartens in the U.S. findings from a multilevel structural equation mediation model suggest that the frequency of state/local standardized testing in kindergarten did not have a direct effect on reading achievement near the end of kindergarten, after controlling for covariates. However, the amount and type of reading instruction mediated the relationship between the frequency of testing and reading achievement, after controlling for covariates. The implications for policy and practice on the use of standardized tests in kindergarten are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Frequency of testing was associated with math instruction. • Frequency of testing had a negative long-term effect on math achievement. • Math instruction mediated the link between testing and math achievement. This study investigates how school-level standardized testing policy at Grade 1 is directly and indirectly linked to math achievement in primary grades. Using nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort data drawn from the U.S., the sample consists of 6774 children nested in 925 elementary schools. Findings from a multilevel full structural mediation analysis indicate that despite children's short-term gains at Grade 1, the positive effects of frequent testing policy at Grade 1 do not persist in Grade 3. In contrast, school-level standardized testing policies were negatively associated with math achievement at Grade 3 mediated by procedural instructional approaches (e.g., drills). The findings provide empirical evidence on the validity of standardized testing in primary-grade mathematics and offer implications for teachers, educational policymakers, and researchers.

AB  - Guided by the consequential test validity theory and data use theory (i.e., theory for making a data-driven educational decision), the present study examined the association between the frequency of kindergarten standardized assessments and children's reading growth from the beginning of kindergarten to the end of first grade. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study – Kindergarten Cohort of 2010–2011, the final sample included 29,568 observations from 7392 children nested in 744 U.S. kindergartens. The findings from multilevel growth modeling indicated that while children on average did not show a faster reading growth rate from taking frequent standardized assessments in kindergarten, the magnitude of the impact varied across subgroups of children. Specifically, Asian children and children of high socioeconomic status (SES) showed a slightly more significant reading growth than that of their peers when they attended kindergartens with frequent standardized assessments. In contrast, Hispanic, Black, other races/ethnicities, low SES, children with disabilities, and English language learners did not show significant reading growth, even when they took standardized assessments more frequently in kindergarten. The study concludes with a discussion of the implication of kindergarten standardized assessment policies regarding the consequential test validity and data use theory. • The kindergarten assessment policies was not associated with reading growth. • The high SES children in schools with stringent kindergarten assessment policies showed more significant reading growth than that of their peers. • The Asian children enrolled in schools with stringent kindergarten assessment policies showed more significant reading growth than that of their peers.

AB  - TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GREAT CITIES SCHOOL PROGRAM IN PHILADELPHIA, A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIMENTAL DEPRIVATION AMONG CHILDREN OF LIMITED BACKGROUNDS, FOUR TYPES OF EVALUATIVE CRITERIA WERE USED IN THIS STUDY AND ARE REPORTED AS FOLLOWS--(1) STANDARDIZED TESTING--THE RESULTS AFTER 2 YEARS WERE COMPARED WITH NORMALLY EXPECTED GROWTH OF STUDENTS OF THIS TYPE. SCORES IN READING, SPELLING, ARITHMETIC FUNDAMENTALS AND ARITHMETIC PROBLEMS WERE COMPARED IN 21 INSTANCES. SOME SUPERIORITY OF GAIN WAS FOUND. THE SLIGHT INCREASE WAS TAKEN AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THE PROGRAM, (2) NONSTANDARDIZED TESTING IN THE FIELD OF READING SHOWED A GROWTH OF 1.15 OVER NORMAL, (3) TEACHER JUDGMENTS BASED ON APPRAISAL OF DAILY WORK AND TESTING INDICATED DEFINITE GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT IN STUDENT ATTITUDE AND COMPETITION, (4) QUESTIONNAIRES WERE GIVEN TO PUPILS AND PARENTS AS WELL AS TO TEACHERS. ALL SCHOOLS REPORTED INCREASE IN PUPIL INTEREST, BETTER BEHAVIOR, BETTER WORK HABITS, AND IMPROVED ATTITUDES IN PEER RELATIONSHIPS, SELF-IMAGE, AND ASPIRATIONAL LEVELS. PARENT COOPERATION, PARENT INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY AND PARENT COMMITMENT TO THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN INCREASED THROUGH EFFORTS OF VOLUNTEER SCHOOL-COMMUNITY COORDINATORS.

AB  - Under the No Child Left Behind Act, states have been required to set minimum proficiency standards that virtually all students must meet by 2014. Sanctions of increasing severity are to be applied to schools that fail to meet interim targets, known as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). The authors examine the effect of this legislation using longitudinal, student-level test score data from seven states (N greater than 2,000,000) between 2002-03 and 2005-06 school years. This paper addresses the following research questions: (1) Has NCLB increased achievement among lower-performing students?; (2) Have these gains come at the expense of students that are already proficient or that are far below the proficiency target? Identification is achieved by exploiting the fact that in the early years of NCLB, not all grades counted for purposes of determining AYP. The estimate of the NCLB effect is therefore based on a comparison of outcomes in high-stakes vs. low-stakes years. The authors find consistent evidence of an achievement trade-off in the hypothesized direction, though the effects on any given student are not large. Unlike some other researchers, they find mixed evidence at best that students far below the proficient level have been harmed by NCLB; indeed, at higher grade levels they appear to have benefited. Effects of NCLB on efficiency, while positive, appear to be modest. NWEA Score Alignment Studies is appended. (Contains 12 figures, 7 tables and 16 footnotes.)

AB  - The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act has compelled states to design school accountability systems based on annual student assessments. The effect of this Federal legislation on the distribution of student achievement is a highly controversial but centrally important question. This study presents evidence on whether NCLB has influenced student achievement based on an analysis of state-level panel data on student test scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). This study identifies the impact of NCLB by relying on comparisons of the test-score changes across states that already had school accountability policies in place prior to NCLB and those that did not. Results indicate that NCLB generated statistically significant increases in the average math performance of 4th graders (effect size = 0.22 by 2007) as well as improvements at the lower and top percentiles. However, the authors do not find consistent evidence that NCLB generated similarly broad improvements in reading achievement or achievement among 8th graders. (Contains 11 tables and 6 footnotes.)

AB  - THE RESULTS OF STANDARDIZED TESTS IN LANGUAGE ARTS COVERING 10 YEARS FOR GRADES NINE THROUGH 12 IN GARY, INDIANA, REVEALED THE NEED FOR A DIRECTED PROGRAM IN VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION. A 2-YEAR PILOT STUDY ON VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT USING THE DIRECT APPROACH WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 5,000 NINTH-GRADE STUDENTS. A PRETEST WAS FOLLOWED BY 20 WEEKLY LESSONS, EACH CONSISTING OF 20 WORDS SELECTED FROM ADOPTED NINTH-GRADE TEXTBOOKS AND ACCOMPANIED BY DEFINITIONS, DIACRITICAL MARKING, SAMPLE SENTENCES, AND SPACES FOR THE STUDENTS' ORIGINAL SENTENCES. WEEKLY TESTS, REVIEW TESTS EVERY 5 WEEKS, AND A POST TEST SIMILAR TO THE PRETEST WERE ADMINISTERED. THE USE OF THE MATERIALS DEVELOPED FOR THIS STUDY WAS RECOMMENDED BY 96 PERCENT OF 55 PARTICIPATING TEACHERS. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THESE TEACHERS OBSERVED A BETTER STUDENT PERFORMANCE ON THE POST TEST. THE MATERIALS USED IN THIS STUDY WERE INCLUDED IN THE REGULAR NINTH-GRADE LANGUAGE CURRICULUM IN GARY SCHOOLS. SAMPLES OF THE PRETEST, WEEKLY LESSONS, WEEKLY TESTS, REVIEW TESTS, AND PROGRESS CHARTS ACCOMPANY THIS ARTICLE. THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN THE "JOURNAL OF READING," VOLUME 10, APRIL 1967. (NS)

AB  - As assessment plays an important role in the process of teaching and learning, this research explored the impacts of formative and summative assessments on academic motivation, attitude toward learning, test anxiety, and self-regulation skill of EFL students in Iran. To fulfill the objectives of this research, 72 Iranian EFL learners were chosen based on the convenience sampling method assigned to two experimental groups (summative group and formative group) and a control group. Then, the groups took the pre-tests of test anxiety, motivation, and self-regulation skill. Then, one experimental group was trained by following the rules of the formative assessment and the other experimental group was taught according to the summative assessment. The control group was instructed without using any preplanned assessment. After a 15-session treatment, the post-tests of the test anxiety, motivation, and self-regulation skill were administered to all groups to assess the impacts of the instruction on their language achievement. Lastly, a questionnaire of attitude was administered to both experimental groups to examine their attitudes towards the impacts of formative and summative assessment on their English learning improvement. The outcomes of one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni tests revealed that both summative and formative assessments were effective but the formative one was more effective on academic motivation, test anxiety, and self-regulation skill. The findings of one sample t-test indicated that the participants had positive attitudes towards summative and formative assessments. Based on the results, it can be concluded that formative assessment is an essential part of teaching that should be used in EFL instructional contexts. The implications of this study can help students to detect their own weaknesses and target areas that need more effort and work.

AB  - The problem of practice on which this study focused was the establishment of interim assessments as a predictive tool and driver of formative assessment practices to improve student performance. The initial phase of the study involved equipping educators with tools to understand each student’s ability to be proficient on the EOG Assessment based on the previous year’s EOG data. The next phase of the study used the predictive capacity of the i-Ready Adaptive Diagnostic Assessment (Curriculum Associates, n.d.) to help identify how formative assessment practices could be used to help students achieve that predicted score—which was, in turn, anticipated to facilitate more students being proficient on the EOG Assessments at the end of the school year. An additional focus of the study was to use the predictive value of the i-Ready Adaptive Diagnostic Assessment to reduce the number of students who lost their proficiency rating from one year to the next. Phase One of the action research adopted here was focused on identifying what formative assessment practices School F used the past three years. The purpose of identifying those practices was so that they had the potential to be used in School B. Part of this was to highlight the importance of understanding at what level of proficiency students commenced the school year, and the development of a plan to ensure they either stayed proficient or grew from being non-proficient to proficient. The aim of the action research phase was to empower the teachers in School B to determine whether students made progress after each administration of the i-Ready Adaptive Diagnostic Assessment. Related professional development sessions equipped the teachers with an understanding of the predicted scores and what interventions they had to implement to ensure students improved between each administration of the i-Ready Adaptive Diagnostic Assessment—thereby ensuring students had the greatest chance of being proficient on the EOG Assessment at the end of the school year.

AB  - Three experiments examined testing effects on learning of natural concepts and metacognitive assessments of such learning. Results revealed that testing enhanced recognition memory and classification accuracy for studied and novel exemplars of bird families on immediate and delayed tests. These effects depended on the balance of study and test trials during training. Metacognitive measures provided results suggesting that participants were aware of the beneficial effects of testing. A new measure of metacognition at the level of categories is introduced and shown to be potentially useful for theory and applied purposes. It is argued that focusing on optimizing the learning of natural concepts encourages the convergence of theorizing about memory, concept learning, and metacognition and holds promise for the development of applications to education.

AB  - Several recent studies have shown that retrieval is more efficient than restudy in enhancing the long-term retention of memories. However, studies investigating this effect in children are still rare. Here, we report an experiment in which third-grade children initially read a brief encyclopaedic text twice and then either performed a cued recall test on selected target contents of the text or reread the same text twice. A final four-choice memory test about the text’s contents was administered to all children after seven days as well as tests measuring their IQ and reading skills. In the final four-choice memory test, children who took the initial cued recall test showed significantly greater performance in comparison with children who restudied the text twice (their responses were 87 and 53% correct, respectively). The results suggest that cued recall tests can elicit very robust testing effects in young children, even when complex, educationally relevant materials are used as stimuli.

AB  - Retrieval-based learning, using tests for content review, frequently proves more effective for knowledge retention compared to alternative methods. Extensive research has explored this with older students, often in contrast to more passive techniques like rereading or note rewriting, typically focusing on vocabulary content, in non-classroom settings and assessing knowledge retention within a week. In this study we conducted a classroom experiment to compare the efficacy of retrieval-based learning to another active method of reviewing content, namely discussion, in promoting long-term knowledge retention among primary school science students. Additionally, we assessed the students’ perceptions of these reviewing methods. A total of eighty-one primary school students participated in the study, which encompassed a lesson conducted at a zoo, followed by a review of the lesson content using either retrieval-based learning or discussion. Our findings indicated no impact of the method of reviewing on knowledge retention after either one week or four weeks. Nevertheless, notable effects were observed in terms of motivation, as students who employed retrieval-based learning for reviewing reported heightened levels of interest and enjoyment, along with perceiving greater benefits from the process. Additionally, boys in the discussion group reported increased curiosity, in contrast to girls who reported an inverse pattern. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The present study examined the utility of two progress monitoring assessment schedules (bimonthly and monthly) as alternatives to monitoring once weekly with curriculum-based measurement in reading (CBM-R). General education students (N = 93) in Grades 2-4 who were at risk for reading difficulties but not yet receiving special education services had their progress monitored via three assessment schedules across 1 academic year. Four mixed-factorial analyses of variance tested the effect of progress monitoring schedule (weekly, bimonthly, monthly), grade (2, 3, and 4), and the interaction effect between schedule and grade on four progress monitoring outcomes: intercept, slope, standard error of the estimate, and standard error of the slope. Results indicated that (a) progress monitoring schedule significantly predicted each outcome, (b) grade predicted each progress monitoring outcome except the standard error of the slope, and (c) the effect of schedule on each outcome did not depend on students' grade levels. Overall, findings from this study reveal that collecting CBM-R data less frequently than weekly may be a viable option for educators monitoring the progress of students in Grades 2-4 who are at risk for reading difficulties.

AB  - This study examined effects of goal setting, frequency of progress monitoring, and method of evaluating progress on the number of instructional change prompts generated by reading-curriculum-based measurements (CBM). Participants were 31 high-incidence special education students in grades 2-6 selected from 8 schools. Following baseline measurements, researchers administered grade-level CBM passages every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Comparisons included 3 goal levels (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 word growth per week), 3 monitoring/evaluation schedules (every 2, 4, or 8 weeks), and 2 methods for evaluating progress (points below the aim line or slope). Overall, more ambitious goals, less frequent monitoring, and using slope to evaluate progress generated more instructional change prompts. Results favored less frequent monitoring and using slope to evaluate progress.

AB  - The testing effect is one of the strongest learning techniques documented to date. Although the effects of testing on high-level learning are promising, fewer studies on this have been done. In this classroom application of the testing effect, we aimed to 1) determine whether a testing effect exists on high-level testing; 2) determine whether higher-level testing has an effect on low-level content retention; and 3) determine whether content knowledge, cognitive skill, or additional components are responsible for this effect. Through a series of two experiments, we confirmed a testing effect on high-level items. However, improved content retention due to testing was not observed. We suggest that this high-level testing effect is due to a better ability to apply specific skills to specific content when this application process has appeared on a previous exam.

AB  - This dissertation investigated the utility of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) writing indices to monitor student progress and serve as an academic intervention. The participants were 257 third-, fifth-, and eighth-grade students from regular and special education. These students were divided into three experimental groups which received CBM writing probes at the beginning and end of the 12-week study (control group), on a weekly basis (weekly group), or on a daily basis (daily group). Students' writing samples were scored using production-dependent (Total Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, and Correct Writing Sequences), production-independent (Percentage of Words Spelled Correctly and Percentage of Correct Writing Sequences), and accurate-production (Correct Minus Incorrect Writing Sequences) CBM indices, and an analytic scoring system. Students' scores on the writing portion of the Illinois Standards Achievement Test were also recorded. The data were used to answer four primary research questions. First, of the various CBM written expression scoring indices, which measures were most appropriate for students of different ages? Second, did more frequent administration of CBM writing probes affect students' writing skills? Third, did the use of CBM written language probes have a differential effect on the writing achievement of students of different educational classification or gender? Fourth, what was the relationship between students' scores on the CBM indices and the ISAT? This dissertation found that the production-independent scoring measures were not sensitive to student gains; however, the production-dependent and accurate-production scoring measures were equally as capable of monitoring increases in students' scores over time. The results of the present study indicated that the students who generated more frequent writing samples generally did not have higher scores than the control students at the end of study. The present study also found that over time, students in special education had similar rates of gain on the CBM scoring indices as students in regular education. Additionally, it was found that girls had significantly higher scores on the majority of CBM indices and the ISAT Total Writing subtest than boys. Finally, the present study revealed a strong relationship between students' scores on the various CBM scoring indices and on the ISAT Total Writing subtest.

AB  - This paper harnesses collaborative annotations by students as learning feedback on online formative assessments to improve the learning achievements of students. Through the developed Web platform, students can conduct formative assessments, collaboratively annotate, and review historical records in a convenient way, while teachers can generate formative assessments, manage collaborative annotations, and spot blockades to student learning in an efficient way. The experiment spanned one semester and underwent midterm and final exams. The results showed that adopting collaborative annotations on formative assessments significantly enhanced the learning achievements of students and extended retention time in the proposed system. Through a questionnaire and interviews, most students expressed positive attitudes toward using the proposed system.

AB  - This study investigated the technical adequacy of 3 simple, 1-min curriculum-based measurements (CBM) for predicting third (n = 35) and fifth (n = 49) graders' performance on a state standards test of mathematics. Measures included 2 numeric CBMs: a traditional basic facts measure and a new "cloze" math facts measure, designed to require deeper understanding of fact families. A silent reading measure served as third predictor CBM. Results indicated that reliability and criterion validity of 1-min administrations were insufficient. When scores from 2 administrations were aggregated, moderate correlations were achieved. Results of aggression analysis showed that reading and cloze math measures each made significant unique contributions to explaining performance on the state math test and together explained 52% of variance at fifth grade and 27% at third grade.

AB  - Istation is a digital-based instructional intervention tool for various content areas aimed at pre-K through 8th grade learners. The Istation Reading program consists of formative assessments, named Istation Indicators of Progress (ISIP™), which are computer-adaptive and diagnostic literacy assessments designed to track student growth over time. Istation Reading also includes an adaptive, online curriculum, which generates personalized learner data profiles that teachers can use to make data-driven instructional decisions and assign custom learning interventions. Istation's Early Reading (ER) program was designed specifically for students in grades K-3, focusing on the critical areas of early reading, including phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and fluency. The ISIP became the state of Idaho's early literacy assessment in the 2018-19 school year. The state-mandated early literacy assessment for students in grades K-3 is referred to as the Idaho Reading Indicator (IRI). The state of Idaho used a different assessment in previous years and switched to using the ISIP for the IRI in the 2018-19 school year. The IRI is administered to all K-3 public school students in the state, and is intended to serve as an early reading diagnostic and screener. A sample of public elementary schools in Idaho piloted the ISIP and the Istation curriculum during the 2017-18 school year. In the 2018-19 school year, all public elementary schools in Idaho administered the ISIP. Schools were required to administer the ISIP in both the fall and spring, and had the option to administer it more frequently for yearly progress monitoring. Schools also had the option of purchasing Istation's related curricular resources. This study examines effects of the Istation ER program on student reading achievement in the state of Idaho and the validity of the ISIP for predicting student performance on the Idaho Standards Achievement Test (ISAT). It also highlights implementation successes and challenges experienced by educators who piloted Istation's ER program during the 2017-18 school year. [Istation contracted with the Center for Research and Reform in Education (CRRE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) to conduct a study of the predictive validity of Istation's Early Reading (ER) program in the state of Idaho.]

AB  - Repeated measurements of student ability (i.e., progressing monitoring) is an essential element of informed decision-making when adjusting instruction. An important characteristic of progress monitoring measures is frequent administration to identify areas of concern and to evaluate academic growth. The purpose of this study was to determine if STAR Math is sensitive to small incremental growth across a semester. Within two southern school districts, 114 fifth grade students' progress monitoring data were collected weekly, and a latent growth curve was used to estimate students' change in math ability. Results indicated STAR Math is sensitive to small incremental growth, with a statistically significant and positive slope, suggesting students using STAR Math showed improvement in ability over the semester.

AB  - Motivating students to watch pre-lesson videos to prepare for class is among the most significant challenges cited with flipped learning. We demonstrate boosting student preparation by up to 29% by implementing start-of-lesson quizzes. This is shown through the comparison of a flipped control group without the quizzes to flipped experimental groups including the quizzes. Results indicate daily, low-stakes quizzes can also reduce failure/withdrawal rates and help maintain student motivation to prepare for class. An 8% improvement in final exam scores was also found in comparison to the previous semester not including methods such as flipped learning. Statistically significant correlations were also found between student perceptions of the class and their video-viewing habits, homework completion and graded event scores.

AB  - This research examined the impact of formative quizzes on e-learning designed to teach volunteers how to tutor struggling readers. Three research questions were addressed: (1) Do embedded quizzes facilitate learning of e-content? (2) Does the announcement of upcoming quizzes affect learning? (3) Does prior knowledge interact with quizzing and learning? Participants (n=178) were randomly assigned to condition: (1) no warning, no quiz (control), (2) no warning, quiz, and (3) warning, quiz. Users demonstrated significant learning gains. A predicted main effect for quiz warning was not supported. However, the effect of quizzes on learning was significantly moderated by the amount of prior experience. Low experience tutors learned significantly more when quizzes were embedded compared with expert tutors - a classic expertise reversal effect. A new neurocognitive interpretation for this effect is presented, as well as a call for more “stealthy” assessments that take into account novelty and the learner's zone of proximal development.

La presente investigacion estudia el impacto de los cuestionarios formativos sobre los programas de e-learning disenados para ensenar a los voluntarios como ser tutores de las personas que tienen dificultades de lectura. La problematica de la investigacion incluye tres preguntas: (1) Son los cuestionarios integrados capaces de facilitar el aprendizaje de contenidos en linea? Hay algun efecto del anuncio de los proximos cuestionarios sobre el aprendizaje? Existe alguna interraccion entre los conocimientos previos, los cuestionarios y el aprendizaje? Los participantes (n=178) fueron distribuidos de manera aleatoria en tres categorias: (1) Ningun anuncio, ningun cuestionario (control); (2) ningun anuncio pero un quiz; y (3) anuncio y cuestionario. Entre los participantes se noto ganancias de aprendizaje significativas. No se noto el impacto principal previsto para el anuncio de los cuestionarios. En cambio el impacto de los cuestionarios sobre el aprendizaje fue matizado de manera significativa por la cantidad de experiencia previa. Los tutores con poca experiencia aprendian mucho mas cuando los cuestionarios eran integrados en comparacion con los tutores expertos- un efecto clasico de inversion de la pericia. Presentamos una nueva interpretacion neurocognitiva para este efecto ademas de una llamada para modos de evaluacion mas furtivos que tomen en cuenta la novedad y la zona de desarrollo proximo del alumno.

AB  - This quantitative study analyzed data to find a valid and reliable assessment for progress monitoring also having predictive power of a student's future reading performance on a state-mandated standardized reading achievement evaluation. The Response to Intervention (RTI) model was implemented in the language arts classrooms of a rural middle school in northeast Georgia to study the effectiveness of instruction for all students, the at-risk, general, and advanced population. This study used Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) and Maze fluency assessments to monitor student progress and to analyze data to drive instruction. The data were gathered weekly over a 23 week period, rotating the ORF and Maze assessments. Stratified random sampling was used to choose the students receiving ORF assessments. The Maze assessments were given to all students in the language arts classrooms. The data were analyzed through multiple regressions to find if there was a relationship between the ORF and Maze assessments and Georgia's reading portions of the Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) or the Ninth Grade Literature and Composition End of Course Test (EOCT). The data indicated that the ORF and Maze assessments were significant predictor variables for the CRCT and EOCT, and the ORF data indicated a stronger correlation.

AB  - As part of standards-based reforms, there is increasing emphasis on ensuring that students with moderate intellectual disabilities (ID), including students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), learn to read. There is also converging evidence that explicit teaching of letter sounds, phonics, and sight words is effective for this population, but that students' responsiveness varies. A critical part of individualizing reading instruction for students with disabilities is the reliable assessment of progress and mastery of reading skills. However, assessment of many students with ID and students with ASD is challenging because of attention, behavioral, and communication issues related to testing situation; therefore, obtaining consistent results often proves to be a difficult task. We hypothesized that alternate assessment presentation formats, as a testing accommodation, would improve the reliability, validity, and consistency of assessment performance. In this study, three different presentation formats--word lists, flash cards, and PowerPoint presentation--were used when administering proximal, curriculum-based reading assessments to determine whether a particular format increased student engagement, reduced the need for prompts, and increased accuracy of identifying known items on the test. While statistical analyses did not support the hypothesis of a format by student effect, visual analysis of the data did suggest that the number of prompts required varied by student as a function of assessment format. Most noteworthy, assessment reliability, estimated with generalizability theory, indicated that reliability increased as a function of format by student.

AB  - The testing effect, defined as the positive effect of retrieval practice (i.e., self-testing) on long-term memory retention relative to other ways to support learning, is a robust empirical phenomenon. Despite substantial scientific evidence for the testing effect, less is known about its effectiveness in relation to individual differences in cognitive ability. In the present study, we examine whether the effect of retrieval practice is beneficial independent of cognitive ability using behavioral and brain imaging data. In a within-subject design, upper-secondary students learned Swahili–Swedish word pairs through retrieval practice and study. The testing effects were assessed at a direct test and for a subsample after 1- and 4-weeks retention intervals, respectively. Another subsample performed the 1-week retention test during functional MRI (fMRI). Memory retention was analyzed in relation to an educationally relevant composite score dividing participants into low, intermediate, and high cognitive-ability groups. We provide behavioral evidence that the testing effect is independent of cognitive ability. The fMRI findings confirmed a general effectiveness of retrieval practice by showing that brain regions associated with successful retrieval of conceptual representations and semantic processing were more strongly engaged after retrieval practice in all cognitive-ability groups. It is argued that the advantages of retrieval practice should be conveyed to all teachers and students. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: A learning strategy, denoted as retrieval practice, is a powerful and easy-to-implement strategy in the classroom and during self-study. In this study, we present behavioral and brain-imaging evidence that retrieval practice is beneficial independent of cognitive ability and leads to more efficient memory consolidation. We argue that the advantages of retrieval practice should be conveyed to all teachers and students.

AB  - Using a longitudinal design, children were given a brief number sense screener (NSB) screener (N = 204) over six time points, from the beginning of kindergarten to the middle of first grade. The NSB is based on research showing the importance of number competence (number, number relations, and number operations) for success in mathematics. Children's mathematics achievement on a validated high-stakes state test was measured 3 years later, at the end of third grade. Test-retest reliability estimates were obtained for the NSB. Two criterion groups were then formed on the basis of the third-grade achievement test (children who met and who did not meet mathematics standards). Diagnostic validity analyses for the NSB were completed using repeated measures analyses of variance and receiver operator curve analyses. Results from all analyses revealed that scores on the NSB in kindergarten and first grade predicted mathematics proficiency in third grade. Areas under the receiver operator curve indicated that the NSB has high diagnostic accuracy (areas under the receiver operator curve = 0.78-0.88). Findings suggest that kindergarten and first-grade performance on the NSB is meaningful for predicting which children experience later mathematics difficulties. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - In this paper, we use data from the German PISA 2003 sample to study the effects of central exit examinations on student performance and student attitudes. Unlike earlier studies we use (i) a value-added measure to pin down the effect of central exit exams on learning in the last year before the exam and (ii) separate test scores for mathematical literacy and curriculum-based knowledge. The findings indicate that central exit exams improve curriculum-based knowledge but do not affect mathematical literacy. Students, although showing a better performance, are less intrinsically motivated in school. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relationship of formative tests to early learning ability of students in the science learning style. This research used an experimental method with a 2 x 2 factorial design. The participants comprised all the students in class VII of the Islamic Junior High School State of Kolaka, a total of 343 students from 9 classes. Sampling was based on the use of a two-stage cluster sampling technique to randomly select four classes of students. The four classes were re-randomized, with two being given formative tests and two being given multiple choice tests. The t-test was used to measure the student learning outcomes. The results showed: (1) the use of formative tests in narrative form in the learning process can provide a measure of higher learning output compared with the use of formative multiple choice tests. (2) For those students who have a high initial ability, the use of formative tests can provide higher learning outcomes compared with the use of multiple choice tests. (3) For those students who have a lower initial ability, the use of formative tests in narrative form does not provide a different outcome to tests in multiple choice formats.

AB  - Natural category learning is important in science education. One strategy that has been empirically supported for enhancing category learning is testing, which facilitates not only the learning of previously studied information (backward testing effect) but also the learning of newly studied information (forward testing effect). However, in category learning, such benefits of testing have mostly been examined without explicit instructions. This is not aligned with a real educational practice where teachers often provide students with explicit instructions that highlight the diagnostic features of the category. Thus, we investigated the effect of interim testing and feature highlighting on rock category learning and whether the provision of feature highlighting further enhances testing benefits. The participants learned 12 rock categories, which were divided into two sections (Sections A and B). They studied a series of rock images with or without feature highlighting and were given an interim test or not on Section A before proceeding to Section B. After Section B, all the participants took a final test in which they had to classify both old and new rock images of the studied categories. Three experiments demonstrated the benefits of interim testing (compared to restudy) for both previously and newly studied categories. However, feature highlighting did not further enhance learning and sometimes even impeded learning. The findings suggest that providing more information is not always better than providing less information in natural category learning.

AB  - This intervention study evaluated the effects of using two types of explicit instruction, curriculum maps and guided questions, compared with simple reviews or repetition to teach core curriculum content to high school students with learning disabilities in a group instruction format. A repeated measures research design was used with six groups of five students each who received each of the three interventions in differing sequences. A test, representing information from each of the three lessons, was administered as a pre-test and post-test. Analysis of results indicated that the use of the curriculum map enhanced learning for the students with learning disabilities more than the use of guiding questions, and the use of guiding questions enhanced learning more than simple reviews of repeated information. Results support the use of curriculum maps to make instruction more explicit by depicting the importance and structure of the content and then using these maps to lead and review learning through guided questioning. Lesson scripts, handouts, and the tests are appended and comprise the majority of the document's contents. (Contains 29 references.) (DB)

AB  - This study aimed at analyzing the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) in improving physics students' conceptual understanding of mechanical waves. This study used a quasiexperimental, pretest-post-test control group design with PBL instruction as a teaching intervention. The participants of this study were 239 physics students from 19 secondary schools in Western Uganda. We analyzed data with SPSS v.23.0 using repeated two-way analysis of variance tests. We found that unlike the superposition of mechanical waves concepts, PBL effectively improves students' understanding of propagation, reflection, and standing waves more than the usual or traditional teaching method. Teachers were recommended to teach with PBL to assess students' difficulties to remedy them and uplift their understanding.

AB  - The main purpose of this meta-analysis study is to investigate how formative assessment practices promote student learning in Turkey. 32 studies with 47 effect sizes that met the specified criteria such as using true experimental or quasi-experimental design and measuring learning outcomes were included as the final analysis in the meta-analytical review method. The overall mean effect size of the study was obtained as 0.72 (SE=0.07, p< 0.05). Further investigation through subgroup analysis showed that the effect sizes made a significant difference on different types of formative feedback. The effect of features of formative assessment interventions on student learning indicated that student initiated formative feedback (d=1.16) and mixed feedback (d=0.83) had a large effect, which was followed by a medium effect of adult initiated formative feedback (d=0.69) and a small effect of computer initiated formative feedback (d=0.42). On the other hand, education level and publication type had no effect on student academic performance in the study. These findings support the positive effect of formative assessment practices on student learning. Such a result suggests that increasing the number of different types of formative assessment practices in the classrooms would promise a considerable contribution to student learning.

AB  - The formative assessment literature has unanimously heralded the benefits of the diagnostic use of assessment to inform curriculum and instruction and improve student performance and achievement. Research in this area has primarily focused on traditional formative assessment practices. More recently, research is beginning to examine the effectiveness of technology-based formative assessment, with the latest studies of this mode formative assessment beginning to replicate the traditional findings. The current study examined one computerized/online formative assessment program, the Diagnostic Online Reading Assessment (DORA), and its relationship to a summative state proficiency test, in addition to examining the multilevel influence of teacher use of this technology-based mode of formative assessment on student DORA growth. Existing state test data from one school district in Colorado and existing DORA scores were obtained. In addition, teacher survey data from the same Colorado school district and across the United States were collected online. Student data from grades 3 through 11 and teacher survey data were analyzed via Hierarchical Linear Growth Modeling and Rasch Analysis to investigate the following three main objectives: (1) Examining if DORA growth is related to state test score growth, (2) Developing a behavioral frequency measure of teacher use of computerized/online formative assessment, the Online Formative Assessment Survey (OFAS), and (3) Investigating the relationship between the OFAS and student DORA growth. Specific to the first objective, it was found that DORA subtest growth was significantly and positively related to state reading test score growth. For the second objective, it was found that a psychometrically sound measure of teacher computerized/online formative assessment practices can be developed. The results rendered a 50-question measure focusing on all elements of teacher use of computerized/online formative assessment, and 10-question measure concentrating solely on how teachers use the results from the computerized/online formative assessment program. In the third objective, it was found that both the 50-question and 10-question OFAS were not significant, positive predictors of student DORA score growth. Although the validation of OFAS scores was not supported, future research should continue to define this theoretical network of relationships, and maintain the measure revision and validation process. The Rasch results provide psychometric support for this newly developed measure, specifically the focus on using the online formative assessment results. Internet-mediated assessment is becoming commonplace in the classroom, and is more frequently being used to replace traditional modes of assessment. The need to examine the extent to which these methods are educationally sound is in high demand. Results from this study can support administrative demands for more efficient, technology-based ways to encourage teachers to use this mode of formative assessment, and in turn, meet state standards and increase student achievement.

AB  - This study determines the effect of a math intervention model that combines the use of formative assessment, feedback, academic vocabulary, and word problems on student achievement scores in an urban middle school (about 1000 each year) from 2010 to 2012. The researcher developed the DARTS model which is an acronym that stands for: Diagnostic, Assessment, Rescue Assignment, Translations, and Story Problems. The model is largely based on the theory of feedback by Hattie and Timperley (2007), and was implemented school-wide in the treatment school beginning in the 2009-2010 school year. The data used for this study includes California Standards Test (CST) math scaled scores, Academic Growth over Time (AGT) school-wide scores, and band-level percentages. T-tests were run to look for significant differences between the years before and during the implementation of the DARTS model at the treatment school. In addition, t-tests were run on the treatment school's CST English, Science, and History scores to compare them to the changes in math scores. The treatment school scores were also compared to scores from two non-treatment similar schools. The results showed that the mean CST math scaled scores increased significantly for all three grade levels at the treatment school in 2010 and 2011. This was not the case, however, for the other content areas (English, Science, and History). The treatment school's math scores were significantly higher than both similar schools during the years that DARTS was implemented. Seven out of seven t-tests showed the treatment school significantly out-performed the respective similar school from 2010 to 2012. AGT scores were higher for the treatment school than the similar schools in 8 out of 10 comparisons for math, but only in 3 out of 14 for other content area comparisons. Overall, the DARTS model was effective in increasing math student achievement scores in the treatment school. Although this study has some limitations, it can be useful for schools looking for a research-based, comprehensive, and feasible intervention model for mathematics that can help raise student achievement.

AB  - This study examined the relation between benchmark data and rate of growth across the year for reading, math computation, and math concepts and applications curriculum-based measures, and a statewide and large-scale achievement test. Results showed that reading and math benchmarks were significantly and moderately correlated with performance on both achievement measures 1 and 2 years later. Rate of growth in first-grade reading was significantly and moderately related to third-grade statewide achievement performance, with the relation decreasing to nonsignificance by Grade 3. Math computation growth was also related to performance on the statewide achievement test. Curriculum-based measures provided adequate diagnostic accuracy for screening of performance on statewide and large-scale achievement tests both 1 and 2 years later. These data suggest the importance of early identification of students who are at risk for developing academic problems in reading and math.

AB  - Recent research on annual growth measured using curriculum-based measurement (CBM) indicates that growth may not be linear across the year and instead varies across semesters. Numerous studies in reading have confirmed this phenomenon with only one study of math computation yielding a similar finding. This study further investigated the presence of differences in growth across triannual benchmarks using math computation and concepts and applications CBMs. Results indicated that there are differences in growth across semesters at certain grade levels with only first-grade computation and fourth-grade concepts and applications yielding linear growth. The practical implications for understanding student growth and for setting progress goals are addressed and future directions for research are suggested.

AB  - Due to changes in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA, 2004), Curriculum-Based Measurement has expanded in its scope. This legislation established Response to Intervention (RtI) methods for use as prevention and early academic intervention to provide assistance to children who are having difficulty learning. According to this law, RtI data, such as Curriculum-Based Measurement for Reading (R-CBM) scores, can be used to determine which students are in need of more intensive interventions and may also be used in the diagnosis of specific learning disabilities, such as reading disabilities (IDEIA, 2004). Currently, there are few evidence-based guidelines that inform R-CBM administration. For example, whether there are differences in R-CBM scores depending on the day of the week they are administered, and whether any such differences may be mitigated by the administration of three R-CBM probes as opposed to a single probe is unknown. Additionally, it is not known if there are significant differences in R-CBM scores if the median or the mean score (of three R-CBM probes) are utilized, and whether any such differences may be affected by the day of the week the probes are administered. The current study investigated the latter two issues. The participants in the study were second-grade students who attended a local public school in south central United States. Data was collected for a period of six weeks during the spring semester. Essentially two questions were addressed. The first question addressed if a significant difference in reading fluency, as indicated by Words Read Correctly per Minute (WRCM) exists depending on the number of probes given and the manner in which they are administered. Four administration conditions were examined: The first condition (Condition A) consisted of the median score of nine probes. For Condition A, three probes were administered to students three times each week. The other three conditions were contrived using the data from Condition A. Condition B consisted of the median score of three probes; each probe was collected on a different day of the week, such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Condition C consisted of the median score of all three probes administered on the middle day of the week (Wednesday). Group D consisted of the first probe administered on Wednesdays, which simulated administering only one probe per week. To determine if there are differences in outcome depending upon the manner in which the probes are administered, a Two-way Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to analyze all of the weekly data. Results suggested that there are differences in WRCM outcome depending upon the day of the week and the number of probes administered. The results indicated that overall, there is no difference in outcome if three probes are administered on one day or three probes spread out over three days during the week over the course of six weeks. Additionally, results showed that there was significantly greater R-CBM variability when one probe is administered in lieu of three probes or nine probes over the course of six weeks. Additional analyses using Repeated Measures ANOVAs were conducted to determine if there were differences between the conditions for each of the six weeks. Differences in outcome changed depending upon which week was examined, with the most consistency evident between Conditions A and B, Conditions A and C, and Conditions B and C. The most variability was seen between Conditions A and D and between Conditions B and D. The second research question examined the difference in outcomes when the mean of scores is used as opposed to the median score. A Two-way Repeated Measures ANOVA was used, and results indicated that over time, there is no difference in outcome if the median or mean score is used across the four conditions.

AB  - Abstract: Two alternative universal screening approaches to identify students with early learning difficulties were examined, along with a combination of these approaches. These approaches, consisting of (a) curriculum-based measurement (CBM) and (b) teacher ratings using Performance Screening Guides (PSGs), served as predictors of achievement tests in reading and mathematics. Participants included 413 students in grades 1, 2, and 3 in Tennessee (n =118) and Wisconsin (n =295) who were divided into six subsamples defined by grade and state. Reading and mathematics achievement tests with established psychometric properties were used as criteria within a concurrent and predictive validity framework. Across both achievement areas, CBM probes shared more variance with criterion measures than did teacher ratings, although teacher ratings added incremental validity among most subsamples. PSGs tended to be more accurate for identifying students in need of assistance at a 1-month interval, whereas CBM probes were more accurate at a 6-month interval. Teachers indicated that (a) false negatives are more problematic than are false positives, (b) both screening methods are useful for identifying early learning difficulties, and (c) both screening methods are useful for identifying students in need of interventions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the two types of measures, when used together, yield valuable information about students who need assistance in reading and mathematics.

AB  - The subjects were members of two sections in educational psychology, numbering 143 students each and matched for sex and initial knowledge of the material. The same tests given in the form of weekly rather than of monthly examinations result in a mean performance which is reliably higher by 12%. Retention by the group tested weekly is 7% superior as tested by a comprehensive examination administered without warning from 5 to 13 weeks after the corresponding periodic tests. Data are given concerning student preference for weekly or monthly tests and concerning the influence of frequency and length of assignments.

AB  - This study examined the effect of testing frequency on student achievement and retention in a tenth-grade biology course in Saudi Arabia. Random cluster sampling was used to select over two thousand tenth-grade biology students in all-male high schools in the country's four most populous school districts. Whole schools were randomly assigned to treatment groups within each of the four school districts. Each control class was quizzed by its teacher on the monthly basis that is standard throughout the country. Experimental classes were quizzed twice a month by their teachers. Frequency of quizzing was the only way in which differing treatments were fostered for experimental and control classes. These teacher-made quizzes were developed by the respective teachers in total independence from the process by which the criterion measures were developed. Two criterion measures were developed, one to assess end-of-course learning and the other to measure retention three months later. These two instruments were developed by the investigator and reviewed by two Ministry Science Supervisors. Each of these parallel objective tests contained 32 items designed to measure the nationally standardized tenth-grade biology curriculum. Results from the end-of-course criterion measure were obtained from 997 students in the experimental group and 954 in the control group. Scores on the delayed retention criterion were secured from 901 experimental students and 825 control students. Students' previous year's scores on the National Science Test were used (a) as a covariate and (b) as a blocking variable by which students were sorted into three achievement levels. Both ANCOVA and ANOVA revealed significant differences ($p$ $<$.001) favoring the experimental group over the control group on both the end-of-course criterion test and the delayed recall criterion test. For each measure, the effect size was.30. Interaction with achievement level was present, but not ordinal; in general, differences between experimental and control groups were greatest for high achieving students. It was concluded that more frequent classroom testing would clearly be beneficial for male Saudi tenth-grade biology students and would likely be beneficial for students in other grades and subjects.

AB  - In this study, I examined the impact of periodic pop quizzes on cumulative final exam scores. Specifically, I compared the impact of using no quizzes, graded quizzes, and ungraded quizzes on final exam scores of introductory psychology students. Quizzed students also completed a survey with questions probing how the students felt about the inclusion of quizzes in the course. Students taking ungraded pop quizzes outperformed students taking graded pop quizzes and students taking no quizzes on the final exam. Students taking ungraded pop quizzes felt positive about having quizzes in their classes. The current findings have implications for research on the mitigating impact of anxiety on test-enhanced learning and on pedagogical strategy selection for educators.

AB  - Adoption of course management software at our school has resulted in use of online quizzes for formative assessment, in favor of supervised quizzes. Current goals were to assess if online quiz score predicts performance on formal examinations and if quizzes are acceptable to students. Performance on 2 online quizzes offered before our most recent midterm examination was analyzed. Each quiz had 25 questions reflecting the style of the midterm. Each quiz was open for 1 wk. The maximum score from 2 possible attempts was recorded. Students reviewed questions they got wrong after their first attempt. Students could earn up to 1% of their final course grade for each quiz, based on their best score from 2 attempts. 96% of students completed the quizzes. 147 scores reflected a single attempt; 500 recorded scores were the better of 2 attempts. There was significant correlation between first quiz attempt and midterm scores (R=0.26, n=500, P<0.01, ANOVA) for students using 2 attempts, indicating predictive validity of quizzes. Students taking quizzes only once scored 96.0±1.0% but did not perform better on the midterm than students using 2 attempts (79% versus 81%), raising concern about unethical use of quizzes in a minority of cases. Students agreed that quizzes were motivating and gave them useful feedback. Students emphasized the importance of giving credit for participation and the need to provide explanations for quiz answers.

AB  - A year long study involving 38 students in grades 1 to 6 was conducted to assess the degree of implementation of a frequent, curriculum-based measurement and evaluation system in classrooms in which the teachers had received training in the system, and to examine the effectiveness of the measurement and evaluation system in terms of enhancing the structure of the instructional lessons and students' reading achievement. The results indicated that although teachers were skillful in the measurement part of the system, they were unsuccessful in applying the evaluation components; students' instructional programs seldom were changed. In terms of the structure of the lessons, only one of the 12 structure variables (controlled practice) yielded significantly higher ratings for experimental than for control subjects. The remaining 11 variables favored experimental subjects, but were not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences in achievement were found between the two groups. All students improved over time. The results suggested that the implementation of a frequent curriculum-based measurement system is feasible and successful in improving the structure of instruction. Achievement effects may be manifest if the evaluation components are applied. (Author)

AB  - Goals 2000 set forth a bold vision for U.S. students: they would be “first in the world in science and mathematics” by the year 2000. Performance indicators such as the TIMSS-R (1999) and NAEP (2000) reports suggest that U.S. students have not yet reached that goal. This study intended to learn how specific assessment strategies might contribute to improved student performance in science. This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of formative assessment with reflection on students' motivational beliefs, self-regulatory skills, and achievement in elementary science. The study aimed to find out whether and how classroom applications of formative assessment during science instruction might influence fifth-grade students' attitudes and self-perceptions about science learning, self-regulatory learning behaviors, and achievement. To explore the effects of the assessment intervention, the study utilized a mixed methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative investigations of treatment and control groups during a four-week intervention period. Quantitative measures included student self-report surveys administered pre- and post-treatment and an end-of-unit science test. Qualitative measures included classroom observations, student interviews (post-treatment), and a teacher interview (post-treatment). Findings indicated that the fifth-grade students in this study had positive attitudes toward science and high levels of self-efficacy for science. Results suggested that these elementary students employed a wide variety of cognitive and metacognitive strategies to support science learning. Findings revealed that these fifth graders believed formative assessment with reflection was beneficial for science learning outcomes. Research results did not show that the formative assessment intervention contributed to significant differences between treatment and control groups. However, the data revealed different levels of academic achievement and self-regulation for students in specific instructional services subgroups (i.e., gifted, regular education, special education, and ESL). For example, high achieving students reported higher levels of self-regulatory learning behavior than other fifth grade students. Findings suggested that elementary science instruction that includes classroom applications of formative assessment with reflection may provide support for science learning and the development of self-regulatory learning behavior. However, widespread implementation of this practice in elementary science classrooms represents significant challenges for today's educators, due to time limitations and increasing accountability pressures in our nation's schools.

AB  - This research proposed to evaluate whether homework or daily quizzes were better for academic success within high-school pre-AP chemistry or if differences in the two methods were detectable. The study involved two years of data where homework was assigned and graded and one year of data where homework was suggested but daily quizzes provided the assessment. The mean of each of the unit tests were evaluated and t-tests were calculated. The results showed that over two-thirds of the units had statistically significant data when daily quizzes were utilized.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not formative assessment strategies enhance the educational learning experience for lower level learners in a mathematics classroom setting. The selected students are supported by a Basic Skills teacher and perform below grade level. The FA group, Formative Assessment group, was given two variations of Formative Assessments to use each day. The IAL group, Instruction as Usual group, continued as is. The formative assessment strategies used were mini white boards and a mathematical graphic organizer allowing the students to determine the problem, question being asked, information provided, which operation to choose, and inverse operations in order to check the work presented. The students were evaluated by performing a Pre and Post Topic assessment. The results had shown that although both groups improved significantly from pre to post assessment, the FA group produced stronger scores.

AB  - The new tests of assessing learning development should be able to test the same competency repeatedly over a longer period of time. This is possible if there are enough parallel tests available or—as in case of the new test Assessing Growth in Mathematical Achievement (Strathmann & Klauer, 2012)—if every child receives each time a randomly generated sample of items representing the set of items that should be mastered at the end of the school year. Moreover, it is essential that the procedure is able to detect increases as well as decreases in the competency. In this contribution it will be tested whether or not the test is sensible to measure changes in competency. This is done by a quasi-experiment to promote mathematical achievement of slow learners in mathematics from twelve classes of elementary schools. The study included a training and a control condition, lasted seven weeks and the course of children's learning progress was documented by pre-, post- und follow-up tests. The results confirm the hypothesis that the test procedure was able to measure change sensibly with underperforming elementary students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS WERE REPORTED. MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED TO COVER 6 WEEKS OF INSTRUCTION IN THE SECOND SEMESTER OF HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS. APPROXIMATELY 3,000 INDIVIDUAL QUESTION-AND-ANSWER FRAMES WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE MATERIALS. TO DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIALS TO STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS COVERING NINE INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS WERE CONDUCTED. THE SUBJECTS CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY 450 STUDENTS IN 15 HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE PHYSICS FILMS (TELECAST DAILY OVER EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION STATIONS IN PITTSBURGH) WERE USED REGULARLY. COMPARISONS OF RESULTS WERE MADE OF CLASSES WHICH RECEIVED THE SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, SUPPLEMENTING THEIR REGULAR PHYSICS COURSE, AND THE CLASSES WHICH RECEIVED ONLY CONVENTIONAL INSTRUCTION. THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATED THAT SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT ATTAINED BY THE SUBJECTS. FURTHER PLANS OF THIS PROJECT WERE SUMMARIZED. RELATED REPORTS ARE ED 003 205 THROUGH ED 003 207, ED 003 214, ED 003 215, AND ED 003 655 THROUGH ED 003 659. (RS)

AB  - The formative classroom assessment using cooperative groups described in this paper has four purposes:(1) to increase students' understanding of concepts through verbal interaction with peers, (2) to provide feedback to the instructor on the cognitive processes students use to answer questions, (3) to reinforce the classroom learning environment, and (4) to model a variety of assessment methods. Students are randomly assigned to groups of four or five just before the test materials are distributed. Each student receives a test booklet and a scantron sheet for his or her answers--to be marked after discussion with the group. Group consensus is neither required nor encouraged. Student reaction to this assessment format has been uniformly positive.

AB  - Taking a pretest before to-be-learned material is studied can improve long-term retention of the material relative to material that was initially only studied. Using weakly associated word pairs (Experiments 1 and 3), Swahili–German word pairs (Experiment 2), and prose passages (Experiment 4) as study material, the present study examined whether this pretesting effect is modulated in size when pretests are repeatedly administered during acquisition. All four experiments consistently showed the typical pretesting effect, with enhanced recall after a single guessing attempt relative to the study-only baseline. Critically, the pretesting effect increased in size when multiple guessing attempts were made during acquisition, regardless of whether the duration of the pretesting phase increased with the number of guesses (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) or was held constant (Experiment 3). The results of Experiment 4 also indicate that neither a single guessing attempt nor multiple guessing attempts easily induce the transfer of learning to previously studied but untested information. Together, the findings demonstrate that additional guesses can promote access to the pretested target material on the final test, suggesting that in educational contexts, extensive pretesting during acquisition may serve as an effective learning strategy.

AB  - Working with a dataset from middle school students' mathematics and reading assessments, this study was conducted to gather evidence regarding effects of formative assessment on student achievement. The study used student usage statistics from an online formative assessment program to examine the effect of formative assessment on student growth scores from end-of-grade summative assessments. The major findings of this study suggest that formative assessments are positively related to student achievement in reading and mathematics. Results suggest that short-cycle reading formative assessments result in positive gains for students in reading. Both student and school-level short-cycle reading formative assessment frequency were observed to have a positive effect on student achievement in reading. The results from this study also suggest that long-cycle mathematics formative assessments may result in positive gains for students. The interaction between student and school-level long-cycle mathematics assessment frequency suggested that students who attend schools that administer a greater number of long-cycle mathematics formative assessments experience positive gains in mathematics achievement. In addition, short-cycle mathematics formative assessments seem to have a particularly stronger positive effect on the achievement of students who are economically disadvantaged.

AB  - School psychologists will likely become more involved in supporting the reading achievement of English language learners (ELLs). This requires evidence-based interventions that are validated for ELL students. Incremental rehearsal (IR) is an evidence-based intervention for teaching words, but the resource intensity often precludes its use. Using peers as interventionists may increase the contextual validity of IR while maintaining the benefits when compared with other drill techniques. This efficacy study examined if (a) peer-mediated IR (PMIR) was effective for teaching ELL students high-frequency words and (b) improvements in word reading generalized to changes in students' oral reading fluency. Five ELL students participated in a randomized multiple-baseline design across participants. Results indicated that PMIR was functionally related to an increase in word reading for all 5 participants. Effect sizes estimated using TauU and multilevel modeling indicated that PMIR had a large effect on sight-word reading. No functional relationship between PMIR and oral reading fluency was observed. PMIR was generally acceptable to target students and peer tutors. Limitations and potential implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - Common universal screening methods for determining math risk in middle school grades may not result in optimal diagnostic accuracy. We evaluated current screening practices and several potential modifications for predicting math proficiency on an end-of-year state test in a suburban school district. Previously, the district used the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) to determine student risk in fall. Creating local cut scores for the preceding-year state test scores and the MAP resulted in the most accurate and efficient methods of assessing risk. Multiskill computation and application curriculum-based measures added little relative value to the combination of MAP and preceding-year state test scores. Results suggest schools could improve their screening practices by first evaluating their current procedures and, if unacceptable, determining whether local cut scores provide the desired improvements to accuracy before considering the adoption of additional measures.

AB  - Formative assessment is a process that engages teachers and students in gathering, interpreting, and using evidence about what and how students are learning in order to facilitate further student learning during a short period of time. The process offers the potential to guide educator decisions about midstream adjustments to instruction that address learner needs in a timely manner. Formative assessment can be implemented in classrooms in various ways. For example, formative assessment can be quick and informal, such as giving students "I learned..." prompts to reflect on and discuss their progress toward lesson objectives. Formative assessment can also be more formal and involve multiple components, such as curriculum-based measurement, to frequently track and analyze individual student learning for the purpose of modifying instruction as warranted (Black & Wiliam, 1998a). Members of Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Central's Formative Assessment Research Alliance, including principals and district administrators, indicated that teachers in the region vary widely in their understanding of formative assessment and how to use it. They wished to focus professional development efforts on formative assessment practices that have evidence of effectiveness for promoting student learning. To address this need, this review identifies studies that examine the effectiveness of formative assessment and provides an overall average estimate of its effectiveness. Alliance members also expressed concern that teachers have difficulty finding time to use formative assessment. One approach to minimizing the formative assessment burden on teachers is to involve students more actively in the process (Black & Wiliam, 1998a). This review also compares the effectiveness of different types of formative assessment, including those directed by students and those directed by other agents, such as educators and computer software programs. The review team conducted a comprehensive search to locate research on formative assessment interventions. After screening studies for relevance, researchers certified in the U.S. Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards and procedures coded and rated each of 76 relevant studies using systematic, rigorous, scientific evidence standards modeled after the WWC study review process and standards (U.S. Department of Education, 2014b). The review team identified 23 studies that it determined had been conducted rigorously enough to have confidence that the formative assessment interventions caused the observed effects on student outcomes. Twenty-two of the studies compared academic outcomes for students participating in formative assessment with academic outcomes for students who did not participate in formative assessment. Nineteen of the 22 studies provided enough information to calculate an effect size, which describes the magnitude of the effect of the intervention. When examining the results across these 19 studies, the review team concluded that: (1) Overall, formative assessment had a positive effect on student academic achievement. On average across all the studies, students who participated in formative assessment performed better on measures of academic achievement than those who did not; (2) Formative assessment used during math instruction had larger effects, on average, than did formative assessment used during reading and writing instruction; (3) Across all subject areas (math, reading, and writing), formative assessment had larger effects on student academic achievement when other agents, such as a teacher or a computer program, directed the formative assessment; (4) For math, both student-directed formative assessment and formative assessment directed by other agents were effective; (5) For reading, other-directed formative assessment was more effective than student-directed formative assessment; and (6) For writing, the effect of other-directed formative assessment on student academic achievement was small, and not enough evidence was available to determine the effectiveness of student-directed formative assessment. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Detailed research findings; (3) Findings from studies that compared two different types of formative assessment; and (4) Studies rated "does not meet standards."

AB  - Hypothesized that a student's motivation and consequently his performance can be affected by reinforcement contingencies under the control of the instructor. The particular variable manipulated was the testing procedure, 'programmed achievement' (PA), which involved requiring the student to evidence 100% mastery of discrete units of material. 2 classes of general psychology served as Ss. For 1 class (n = 36) the PA contingency was in effect the 1st 1/2 of the semester. For the 2nd class (n = 48) the PA contingency was in effect the last 1/2. Ss under the PA contingency evidenced significantly better performance on both weekly quizzes and major exams (p < .05). It is concluded that the PA test contingency significantly affected the way in which an S prepared for an examination. Results support the hypothesis.

AB  - By the time students transition from elementary to middle school, many do not demonstrate mastery of recalling basic math facts. This 8-week quasi-experimental quantitative study, based in cognitive development and theories of the construction of memory, used a 3-level independent variable experimental design to determine if there was a relationship between teachers’ implementation of timed drill practices and the students’ level of automaticity with regard to basic multiplication facts in 9 sixth-grade, regular education math classes. The control group received no intervention, the first treatment group received weekly timed drill practice for 3 minutes, and a second treatment group received daily timed drill practice for 3 minutes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were used to measure the differences in pretest and posttest scores among the 3 treatment groups. Although no significant difference was found among the 3 groups’ pretest performance, a significant difference among posttest performance was found. Scheffe’ post hoc analysis revealed that the students who were administered daily timed practice drills performed statistically higher on the posttest than did the control group and first treatment group. Similarly, students in the weekly timed practice drill group had statistically significant higher gain scores than did students in the no treatment group. This study may lead to a shift in teachers’ thought and practice regarding use of timed practice drills with the result of an increase of automaticity of basic math facts. Improved automaticity may lead to positive social changes including superior performance in math for regular education students that can lead to an increased sense of self-efficacy and higher graduation rates.

AB  - ASSISTments is a web-based math tutor designed to address the need for timely student assessment while simultaneously providing instruction, thereby avoiding lost instruction time that typically occurs during assessment. This article presents a quasi-experiment that evaluates whether ASSISTments use has an effect on improving middle school students' year-end test scores. The data was collected from 1240 seventh graders in three treatment schools and one comparison school. Post-test (7th grade year-end test) results indicate, after adjusting for the pre-test (6th grade year-end test), that students in the treatment schools significantly outperformed students in the comparison school and the difference was especially present for special education students. A usage analysis reveals that greater student use of ASSISTments is associated with greater learning consistent with the hypothesis that it is useful as a tutoring system. We also found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that teachers adapt their whole class instruction based on overall student performance in ASSISTments. Namely, increased teacher use (i.e., having more students use the system more often) is associated with greater learning among students with little or no use, suggesting that those students may have benefited from teachers adapting their whole-class instruction based on what they learned from ASSISTments use reports. These results indicate potential for using technology to provide students instruction during assessment and to give teachers fast and continuous feedback on student progress.

AB  - Interim assessments are increasingly common in U.S. schools. We use high-quality data from a large-scale school-level cluster randomized experiment to examine the impact of two well-known commercial interim assessment programs on mathematics and reading achievement in Indiana. Results indicate that the treatment effects are positive but not consistently significant. The treatment effects are smaller in lower grades (i.e., kindergarten to second grade) and larger in upper grades (i.e., third to eighth grade). Significant treatment effects are detected in Grades 3 to 8, especially in third- and fourth-grade reading and in fifth- and sixth-grade mathematics.

AB  - Motivated by the passage of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, all states operate accountability systems that measure and report school and student performance annually. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of interim assessments on the achievement gap. The authors examine the impact of interim assessments throughout the distribution of student achievement with a focus on the lower tail of the achievement distribution. Specifically, they investigated the effects of two interim assessment programs (i.e., "mCLASS" and "Acuity") on mathematics and reading achievement for high- median- and low-achievers. They use data from a large-scale experiment conducted in the state of Indiana in the 2009-2010 school year. Quantile regression is used to analyze student data. The study was a large-scale experiment conducted in Indiana during the 2009-2010 academic year and included K-8 public schools that had volunteered to participate in the intervention in the spring of 2009. From a stratified (by school urbanicity) pool of 116 schools the authors randomly selected 70 schools. Ten of the 70 schools had used one or both assessment programs the prior year and were excluded from the pool. Two other schools closed and another school did not provide any student data. Thus, the final sample included 57 schools, 35 in treatment and 22 in control condition. Overall, nearly 20,000 students participated in the study during the 2009-2010 school year. The design was a two-level cluster randomized design. Students were nested within schools, and schools were nested within treatment and control conditions. Schools were randomly assigned to a treatment (interim assessment) or a control condition. The schools in the treatment condition received "mCLASS" and "Acuity", and the training associated with each program. The control schools operated under business-as-usual conditions. Overall, the findings suggest that the treatment effect was positive, but not consistently significant across all grades. Significant treatment estimates were observed in the grade 3-8 analysis in mathematics. The estimates were typically larger for low-achievers and in some cases significant. These results are consistent in terms of the sign of the effect (i.e., positive), but inconsistent in terms of statistical significance. The authors observed positive, statistically significant effects for grades 3-8 especially in mathematics. It seems that "Acuity" affected mathematics and reading achievement positively and in some instances considerably in grades 3-6.

AB  - We use data from a large-scale experiment conducted in Indiana in 2009-2010 to examine the impact of two interim assessment programs (mCLASS and Acuity) across the mathematics and reading achievement distributions. Specifically, we focus on whether the use of interim assessments has a particularly strong effect on improving outcomes for low achievers. Quantile regression is used to estimate treatment effects across the entire achievement distribution (i.e., provide estimates in the lower, middle, or upper tails). Results indicate that in Grades 3 to 8 (particularly third, fifth, and sixth) lower achievers seem to benefit more from interim assessments than higher achieving students.

AB  - We use data from a large-scale, school-level randomized experiment conducted in 2010-2011 in public schools in Indiana. Our sample includes more than 30,000 students in 70 schools. We examine the impact of two interim assessment programs (i.e., mCLASS in Grades K-2 and Acuity in Grades 3--8) on mathematics and reading achievement. Two-level models were used to capture the nesting in the data. Results indicate that the treatment effect is insignificant in Grades 3-8, and thus students in treatment schools perform as well as students in control schools. In contrast, the treatment effect is negative and significant in Grades K-2 (i.e., kindergarten and second grade), indicating that students in control schools perform higher than students in treatment schools.

AB  - This study investigated interim assessments effects on the achievement gap. The data were collected from a field experiment conducted in 2010–2011 in K-8 public schools in Indiana in the U.S. Two-level models were utilized to determine whether interim assessments interacted with student SES, race, level of prior achievement, gender, school composition and urbanicity. The results are overall mixed. The majority of the interaction effects are close to zero and statistically non-significant. However, the treatment may have helped reduce the gender and race gaps in reading and mathematics in grades 3–8. The treatment may also have helped reduce the achievement gap between middle- and high-achievers in grades 3–8. The interactions between interim assessments and school composition and urbanicity were overall non-significant.

AB  - This study compares several methods of examinations given in both an introductory solid mechanics course and a follow-up machine component design course. To help determine the best frequency of evaluating student performance, several examination schedules are compared for each course. For the introductory solid mechanics course, three exam schedules were used: Three equally-distributed 75 minute exams with a 120 minute final exam; two 75-minute midterms, daily five-minute clicker quizzes and a 120 minute final exam; and six or seven shorter 40 minute exams in addition to the final exam. The machine component design course used two different schedules: Two equally-distributed 120 minute exams; and six or seven equally-distributed 50-minute exams. Neither exam schedule for the machine component design course used a final exam. Typically, the longer exams (75 minutes and longer) each had three or four problems, while the shorter 40 or 50 minute exams had two problems each. The relative effectiveness of each method is evaluated using outcomes assessment data from the exam questions given and via student self-assessment. From the instructor point of view, it is found that offering what amounts to twelve to fifteen midterm problems over the course of the semester instead of nine to twelve allowed for finer evaluation of student outcomes. That is, a problem could be given early in the semester that tests stress transformations explicitly via a predetermined set of axial and shear stresses. Later in the term, a more complex problem requiring students to evaluate these stresses and then find the appropriate principal stresses could be offered, allowing the instructor to assess each of these steps in a more straightforward manner. Performance on midterm and final examinations using each schedule is compared. Both methods are tested for students' ability to demonstrate knowledge of new concepts as they are taught via midterm performance, and ability to retain these concepts on a cumulative final exam. It is found that student performance on these midterms is improved when more midterms are offered rather than fewer. Further, the data show comparable final exam performance regardless of the number of midterm exams offered. Lastly, students' self-assessment of learning is improved when there are more midterms in the course; students feel that they have learned concepts more thoroughly when there are more exams. The data show a similar understanding at the end of the course no matter which schedule is used.

AB  - In numerous component analyses of F. S. Keller's (see record [rid]1969-04532-001[/rid]) Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), educational researchers have systematically varied features of personalized instruction and observed the effects of their manipulations on instructional outcomes. The present paper discusses the methodology and reviews the results of these component analyses. The review demonstrates the importance for effective instruction of at least 4 PSI features: frequent quizzing, immediate feedback, a mastery requirement, and review units or items. The review suggests that students learn and retain more in PSI classes when (a) their progress is frequently evaluated on brief quizzes, (b) they receive feedback immediately after each assessment, (c) they are required to redo work until mastery is achieved, and (d) they are evaluated on review tests as well as after original learning.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the students' understanding of motion in straight line concepts and their difficulties after the learning process. The research method is a mixed method with an embedded experimental design. The research was conducted in one of the public senior high schools in Malang City Indonesia with 34 students consisting of 20 women and 14 men. The research instrument was used reasoned multiple-choice questions with a reliability of 0.814. The results showed that integrated Formative E-Assessment in modeling instruction learning significantly improved students' understanding of concepts with N-gain = 0.41 and d effect size = 1.902. Found some difficulties experienced by students after learning takes place, among others, in understanding the graph of the position and speed of time. The combination of modeling instruction with e-formative assessment can be an alternative to improve students' understanding of motion in straight line.

AB  - In a physics classroom, kinematics is an essential concept that must be mastered before learning others. The students need ongoing practice and assistance in understanding it. Formative assessment is one of the alternatives to help students reshape their conceptual understanding, but its implementation is often constrained. The implementation of isomorphic multiple choice items as part of computer games is expected to help them overcome the problems. Physics Formative Feedback Game (PF2G) has been developed by utilizing isomorphic multiple choice items. Based on the results of the initial trial, PF2G got a good response, from the physics teacher and also from the students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Regular assessment is a vital part of effective teaching and learning. For this, the "one-minute paper" has been popular among faculty. While many teachers who have used it find huge benefits from it, there are also several weaknesses of this tool that are commonly reported by its users. This paper suggests the "daily quiz" as a better tool for assessing and promoting students' learning. The tool provides a better incentive setup that elicits a more sustained serious response-effort from the students, as well as a sharper focus in assessing cognitive learning. Furthermore, research results in the literature on the effects of frequent testing and the notion of "effortful retrieval" support the author's experience with the daily quiz. End-of-term surveys of students' opinions about the usefulness of the daily quiz also confirm the tremendous benefits from this tool. This paper compares the major characteristics of the "minute-paper" versus the daily quiz, based on a survey of the literature as well as the author's experiences with these tools. This paper will be of interest to those who employ (or are planning to employ) frequent assessment in their classes. It gives them an analysis of the costs and benefits of two common assessment tools.

AB  - Advances in neuroscience technology have allowed brain scientists to learn more about what occurs in the brain when a person engages in -- and learns -- something. And the findings in neuroscience have tremendous value to us educators in our efforts to foster engagement and learning among students in our classes. Following up on a previously published paper on daily quizzes as an assessment tool, this paper now focuses on how and why the daily quiz could work well in getting students to engage and learn. The author relates what neuroscientists have found when the human brain is exposed to, and processes, information. One of their major findings is the so-called 'testing effect'. He then connects the neuroscience findings with his own experiences with daily quizzes, of both the ungraded and the graded sorts, in his classes. He gathered students' feedback and reflections on the quizzes. The quizzes are very short -- about 5 to 8 minutes at a time. But he and his students have found them to be effective tools that foster deep learning. In this paper, he makes the connections between what neuroscientists are finding and what his students are revealing about how and why the daily quiz works.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of formative assessment practices on students' academic achievement, attitudes towards mathematics, and to investigate their views on formative assessment practices. A 12-week quasi-experimental research design was adopted in the research. The research group consisted of 51 students in the 10th grade (26 in the experimental group and 25 in the control group) of a high school. Qualitative data were obtained via "functions academic test" and "mathematics attitude scale" while a semi-structured interview form was used as a qualitative data collection tool. The quantitative results revealed that the effect of formative assessment practices on students' attitudes towards mathematics and mathematics achievement was statistically significant. According to the qualitative results of the research, formative assessment practices were found to be beneficial in terms of contributing to learning processes and encouraging students to express themselves in the classroom. It is recommended that teachers use formative assessment to support student-centered classrooms in teaching mathematics and to effectively evaluate students' mathematical competence in the learning process.

AB  - In response to test-based accountability (No Child Left Behind, 2001), schools and districts across the country are adopting a variety of supplemental assessments aimed at improving student performance. These interim assessments are administered more than once during the school year for the following purposes: (1) predicting student performance on summative accountability tests, (2) identifying student strengths and weaknesses, (3) tracking student progress toward 'proficiency,' or (4) identifying students for remedial instruction. Vendors claim these assessments can improve teaching and learning, although critics contend they do not possess a number of attributes theorized to facilitate formative use of results, including particular assessment features, instructional practices, and school-level supports. To date, empirical evidence on interim assessments is scarce. Thus, this study collected the first empirical evidence on the use of interim assessments in reading and math in Iowa elementary schools. Elementary school administrators completed a survey regarding their school or district’s use of interim assessments. Respondents provided basic descriptive information and also indicated how teachers use assessment results to modify teaching and learning and the types of professional development opportunities available. A companion teacher survey designed to capture teachers’ use of assessment information to improve teaching and learning was constructed. This draft teacher survey was pilot-tested with a small sample of teachers in order to improve its clarity by identifying areas of ambiguity. Feedback generated from these interviews was used to revise the teacher survey. Study results suggest widespread use of interim assessments among respondents, particularly for the improvement of reading skills and primarily for instructional and remediation purposes. These reading assessments appeared to exhibit many of the characteristics deemed essential for formative use of assessment results. However, both survey and interview results suggested teachers have little autonomy for deciding when assessments will be administered. Results also suggest there is much room for improvement in teachers’ formative use of assessment results, as one of the most important aspects of formative use (responding to results by modifying instruction and identifying alternative pedagogies) may also be the least used by classroom teachers and the most neglected with respect to professional development.

AB  - The study aims to investigate teachers' and students' perspectives of how "the formative use of summative test" (i.e., test preparation) may impact student's performance in internal school tests and develop self-regulated learning. It also examines the relationship between formative and summative assessment, especially how they could create productive synergies. Two teachers and 14 Grades 2 and 3 students were interviewed before and after the use of test preparation strategies. Classroom observations were conducted to understand how these strategies helped students to monitor their own learning before the internal school tests. Relevant pre-test instructional materials were also analyzed. Findings suggest that the reported test preparation strategies could enhance student performance and promote modest self-regulated learning. Implications for teachers to adopt pre-test preparation strategies are discussed.

AB  - The Florida Center for Research in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (FCR-STEM) was awarded a grant by the Florida Department of Education to develop a Mathematics Formative Assessment System (MFAS) aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Intended for both teachers and students, formative assessment is a process that provides feedback to adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve students' achievement of instructional goals. The evidence collected enables teachers to differentiate instruction based on students' mathematical thinking and reasoning rather than solely on incorrect answers. The MFAS-CCSS was designed to provide teachers with tasks and rubrics to employ the following five key strategies: (1) assess the student's level of understanding during instruction; (2) identify the student's specific misconceptions and errors; (3) examine samples of student work for further evidence of student understanding; (4) pose additional questions to elicit student thinking; and (5) obtain guidance on next steps for instruction. The current study--the MFAS-CCSS 2012-13 Study--is the third randomized field trial conducted on MFAS. The purpose was to evaluate the effect the MFAS-CCSS has on teachers' knowledge of elementary mathematics and students' mathematics learning in Grades K-1. The MFAS-CCSS 2012-13 Study made use of intervention protocols and measures developed, field tested, and validated in the prior two pilot studies. Two tables are appended.

AB  - Investigated a model of test performance that operated under the assumption that groups of individuals in different performance conditions would react differently to intensified test instruction. Learning disabled (LD) and regular school students (mean age 10.6 yrs) served as Ss in a 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design with repeated measurements. Experimental factors were type of school, age, and type of test administration (repetition of test under conditions of intensified or standard instruction). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with performance scores from the 1st testing as covariates yielded significant effects for test type and type of attended school. Comparison of 1st and 2nd testing showed that LD Ss improved performance only under conditions of intensified instructions, whereas regular school Ss improved their scores under both conditions.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to test the theory of action hypothesized for the Mathematics Formative Assessment System (MFAS) based on results from a large-scale randomized field trial. Using a multilevel structural equation modeling analytic approach with multiple latent response variables decomposed across student, teacher, and school levels of clustering, the current study found evidence of effects of MFAS that were consistent with the MFAS theory of action. First, assignment to the treatment condition was associated with higher mean student mathematics performance and a higher prevalence of small group instruction compared to schools assigned to the control condition—both of which are outcomes hypothesized to result from MFAS use. Also, a positive association between teacher-level mathematics knowledge for teaching and student mathematics performance was found in the current study, which is consistent with the interrelation of constructs specified in the MFAS theory of action. However, evidence of the particular linkages of MFAS use→teacher knowledge→classroom practice→student mathematics performance and the putative cascade of effects that would substantiate the mechanisms of change posited in the MFAS theory of action were not detected in the current study. Thus, positive effects of MFAS on teacher and student outcomes were substantiated; however, as to how the effects of MFAS on teachers transfer to improved outcomes for students remains to be empirically demonstrated. Based on my review of the results from the current study and consideration of the literature on formative assessment as it relates to the design of MFAS tasks and rubrics, I discuss a proposed modification to the theory of action that specifies the addition of a direct path from MFAS use to student mathematics performance, in addition to the indirect path currently specified.

AB  - It is almost universally agreed that more frequent formative assessment (homework, clicker questions, practice tests, etc.) leads to better student performance and generally better course evaluations. There is, however, only anecdotal evidence that the same would be true for more frequent summative assessment (exams). There maybe many arguments against giving more exams, including the general "pain" associated with examinations, as well as reduced teaching time, since classroom sessions are dedicated to exams rather than lecturing. We present evidence that increasing the number of exams in fact does lead to better learning success, less cheating and guessing on homework, and better student course evaluations.

AB  - Answers 2 questions: (1) is the systematic desensitization of test anxiety effective with secondary school students; and (2) is relaxation per se as useful a technique as systematic desensitization? High-test-anxious secondary school students were assigned to 1 of 2 experimental conditions, desensitization or relaxation, and met for 20 min. daily for a period of 6 wk. Their results were compared to those of a no-treatment control group. It appeared that the experimental Ss underwent a significant reduction in anxiety; however, only among Grade 13 Ss was there a trend toward improved academic performance. The relaxation per se treatment was more effective in reducing general anxiety than systematic desensitization. The results and their implications for future research are discussed. (15 ref.)

AB  - The testing effect occurs when learners who are tested rather than relearning material perform better on a final test than those who relearn. Based on cognitive load theory, it was predicted that the testing effect may not be obtained when the material being learned is high in element interactivity. Three experiments investigated conditions of the phenomenon using school students aged 8 to 9 years learning to interpret and use a bus table. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicated a reverse testing effect on an immediate test. Experiment 3 was similar to Experiments 1 and 2 but had a 1-week delayed test which showed no significant effect. It was suggested that the failure to obtain a testing effect was determined by the high levels of element interactivity of the material that had to be learned.

AB  - The testing effect occurs when students, given information to learn and then practice during a test, perform better on a subsequent content post-test than students who restudy the information as a substitute for the practice test. The effect is often weaker or reversed if immediate rather than delayed post-tests are used. The weakening may be due to differential working memory resource depletion on immediate post-tests with resource recovery due to rest following a delayed post-test. In three experiments, we compared an immediate post-test with a 1-week delayed post-test. Experiment 1 required the students to construct a puzzle poem and found working memory resource depletion occurred immediately after learning compared to a delay. Experiment 2 using text-based material tapping lower element interactivity information and experiment 3, again using a puzzle poem, compared study-only with the study and test groups. A disordinal interaction was obtained in both experiments with the study-only groups superior to the study–test groups on immediate content post-tests and reverse results on delayed tests. Working memory capacity tests indicated a non-significant increase in capacity after a delay compared to immediately after learning with medium size effects, but in experiment 2, there were no working memory differences between the study-only and the study and test groups. Experiment 3 increased element interactivity and found an increased memory capacity for the study-only group compared to the study and test group with the immediate test contributing more of the difference than the delayed test. It was concluded that increased working memory depletion immediately following learning with a test contributes to the failure to obtain a testing effect using immediate tests.

AB  - A study evaluated the effect software for self-assessment and management of reading practice had on reading achievement and motivation in two primary schools in Aberdeen, Scotland. The program utilized was The Accelerated Reader (AR) which was designed to enable curriculum based assessment of reading comprehension within the classroom. Students using the program in both schools (Project A and Project B) read real books from a selection of 150 titles on the AR book list. Students then took tests consisting of multiple-choice questions on the computer which analyzed and summarized the results helping the teacher to manage effective reading practice. Quantitative and qualitative results indicated that even when less than fully implemented, the Accelerated Reader program yielded gains in reading achievement greater than regular classroom teaching and an alternative intensive method, even with less time devoted to class silent reading practice than in comparison classes. Results also displayed significant differences in attitudes to reading for boys and girls. (Contains 67 references, and 11 figures and 9 tables of data. Appendixes present survey instruments, titles available for the UK version of the AR program, a sample at-risk report, problem types and possible causes (found on the at-risk reports), the color-coding system for Project A and Project B, student reading logs, the duolog reading process, Accelerated Reader shop prizes, tables of data, and a follow-up study for Project A.)

AB  - The present study examined the technical adequacy of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) of early numeracy. Six 1-min early mathematics tasks were administered to 137 kindergarten and first-grade students, along with an omnibus test of early mathematics. The CBM measures included Count Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, Missing Number, Next Number, and Number Facts. Alpha and split-half reliabilities were assessed, and construct validity and criterion validity (both concurrent and predictive) were examined. In addition, an item analysis was conducted for each measure using classical test theory and item response theory approaches, specifically using a Rasch model. Results indicated that the measures produced moderately strong reliability coefficients, satisfactory item difficulty and discrimination, evidence to support both concurrent and predictive validity with the standardized early mathematics test, and the tasks appeared to be measuring the construct of early numeracy proficiency.

AB  - Historically, urban high school students encounter socioeconomic, educational, and systematic barriers in pursuit of college acceptance and admissions (VanTassel-Baska and Willis, 1987; Freedle, 2003; Dixon-Roman, Everson, and McArdle, 2013). These same hurdles are ever present for these students in their enrollment in SAT test then the SAT scores. Furthermore, urban students with learning and/or language differences are further disadvantaged by compounding variables of socioeconomics, disability, and access to resources. Given the significance of SAT scores in college admission, it is imperative that disadvantaged students from urban communities are provided proper support, guidance and instruction thought non-profit community organization that serve as college access conduits. This research study examine SAT Verbal prep offered through the Upward Bound program. SAT Verbal was offered through two instructional modes: teacher-led lecture or student-authored multimedia instruction. SAT Verbal instruction type was compared with a small sampling of students enrolled in Dual Enrollment to determine which SAT instruction increased scores beyond exposure to college level coursework. Three different groups were used in this pre-posttest design that utilized a combination of unique randomization and non-randomized group placements (n=101). Pre and posttest were analyzed with ANCOVAs to evaluate mean changes across the groups. Results indicate that students participating in high frequency academic vocabulary CAPs experienced a highly statistically signification casual effect of increasing scores on SAT Composite(p<.00) and SAT Verbal scores (p<.00). These results are even more pronounced in student groups with learning or language differences. Diverse students enrolled in multimedia instruction saw their SAT Composite scores increases (ELL=5.34%, IEP=18.12%) and SAT Verbal scores (ELL-3.67%, IEP 12.88%). These results support use of CAPS to address language, learning, access, and socio-economic issues that hinder urban students from high achievement on SAT, and ultimately college admission.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of constructed-response spelling procedures with disadvantaged children attending a public inner-city elementary school. Ten students of primarily Cape Verdean descent participated in the study as part of a classroom-wide implementation of constructed-response procedures. A multiple-treatment design was used to assess the effectiveness of the constructed-response strategy versus traditional spelling instruction. The dependent variable was the percent of words spelled correctly on weekly spelling tests. Results indicated that mean spelling scores were higher during both constructed-response conditions than during traditional instruction for 9 of the 10 students. The relationship between spelling proficiency and literacy development is discussed. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Students in 4 classes had a short exam at the start of every class. Grades were significantly better than in previous classes where the same material was taught but with only 4 exams, and there were fewer withdrawals from the exam-a-day classes. Students taught with the exam-a-day procedure also performed better on a retention test than did students from classes taught using less frequent exams. Responses to anonymous questionnaires administered in all 4 classes indicated that most students believed having an exam every day led to more studying and better learning than in their other classes and that they liked the procedure.

AB  - The focus of this research was to examine instructional methods and programs that have the potential of closing the achievement gap for children who did not experience rich oral language development in the early years. The study was conducted in an inner-city, high poverty school, with a high percentage of second language learners (88%), while they were implementing a new reading program with a strong oral language component. This increased focus on vocabulary has shown statistically significant gains in reading achievement as measured by the MCAS. This study began in the spring of 2010 with grade three students when the new reading program was being implemented. Both third grade classes showed statistically significant gains in vocabulary growth, as well as in over-all reading achievement. These data agree with the current research, which suggests that the increased time and emphasis on vocabulary development can have a positive effect on reading achievement. During the second year of the study, half of the original study group (now in grade four) received vocabulary instruction using additional research based strategies, combined with the new reading program. The other half of the study participants (control group) received instruction using the new reading program alone. The experimental group made significant gains over the control group in reading achievement. In addition to analyzing test scores to determine gains in reading achievement, qualitative data was collected on the fidelity of the implementation of the new reading program, as well as the frequency of strategies used and amount of time spent on vocabulary development. This data was collected through classroom observations and conversations with the classroom teachers involved in the study. The implications for practice are evident. It is not just the need for increased time spent on vocabulary development, but the quality of instructional practices that must be improved, as well.

AB  - Previous research on students with learning disabilities has indicated that they benefit most from explicit instruction. However, few studies have examined how explicit instruction may be translated to the logistical demands associated with large-group instruction in high school general education settings in ways that are socially acceptable to high school teachers. This intervention study evaluated the effects of two types of explicit instruction, curriculum maps and guiding questions, compared to the use of simple reviews of repeated information. Each was used to teach core curriculum content in a group-instruction format with 30 high school students with learning disabilities. A repeated-measures research design was used. Results of the comparison of student test scores associated with the three interventions indicated that the use of the curriculum maps significantly enhanced learning for students with learning disabilities more than guiding questions, and the use of guiding questions enhanced learning more than simple reviews of repeated information. Based on these findings, core curriculum general education teachers may be able to begin making their instruction more explicit and powerful by incorporating simple routines comprised of the use of curriculum maps to depict the importance and structure of the content and using these maps to lead and review learning through guided and interactive questioning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between scores on two common curriculum-based measures (CBMs), oral reading fluency (ORF) and maze, and scores on the previous statewide assessment of reading in Oregon (Oregon Assessment of Knowledge and Skills-Reading/Literature [OAKS-R]). Data obtained from three cohorts of eighth-grade students were used to examine CBM validity, and the relationship between student characteristics and OAKS-R performance. Positive relationships between ORF and maze scores and performance on the OAKS-R were obtained. In addition, the strength of the predictive relationships varied across cohorts, but not as a function of student characteristics. These results suggest that eighth-grade CBM data can be used as an efficient means to identify and intervene with those at risk of performing poorly on the end-of-year, high stakes accountability assessment. Consideration of the tradeoffs associated with using one or more CBMs in middle school is provided.

AB  - Central exams are often hypothesized to favorably affect incentive structures in schools. Indeed, previous research provides vast evidence on the positive effects of central exams on student test scores. But critics warn that these effects may arise through the strategic behavior of students and teachers, which may not affect human capital accumulation in the long run. Exploiting variation in examination types across school systems and over time, we provide the first evidence that central exams positively affect adult skills. However, estimated effects on skills are small and we find no significant average effect on earnings.

AB  - The present study examined the ability of curriculum-based dynamic assessment that emphasizes a triarchic model of intelligence to reveal learning potential and developing expertise in a classroom setting compared to ability revealed by classic paper and pencil tests. While a large body of research points to the effectiveness of dynamic assessment as an alternative to classic intelligence tests in terms of its ability to demonstrate hidden expertise, there is a dearth of research on its utility as an alternative curriculum-based measure in classroom settings. In addition, the present study examined the impact of triarchic instruction, alone and in conjunction with dynamic assessment, over classic classroom instruction on students' performance on standardized achievement tests. This was a field study of 248 participants that compared three study groups, each composed of regular education fourth grade students from tri-state area public schools. Results indicated that dynamic assessment was effective in helping students demonstrate expertise over studied classroom material compared to peers who were required to demonstrate their expertise through paper and pencil tests. Further, in contrast to static assessment, dynamic assessment helped students who performed poorly on a baseline math achievement test show equal expertise over classroom material as their peers who did well on the achievement test. Finally, results indicated that triarchic instruction itself significantly improved students' performance on standardized tests over classic instruction. This was a pioneer study bridging the theory and research on dynamic assessment to the body of research on strategies for best practices in classroom instruction and assessment. In bridging these two areas, it further linked psychological theory with educational practice, and provided nuanced findings that contribute to clinicians' and educators' understanding of learning processes and learning potential. The findings in this study provide clinicians and educators with effective strategies for recognizing latent potential in underachieving students, and access to the instruction and assessment tools that can help those students demonstrate greater ability. Most importantly, this research provides students currently at risk of academic failure and the damaging psychological and social consequences that can result, hope of present and future academic success.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to attempt to determine if score gains obtained upon repeated testing with an intelligence test result from a practice effect, from students remembering specific items, or from a combination of both. The verbal and nonverbal batteries of an I.Q. test were administered to 860 sixth graders on three occasions with two-month and four-month intervals between testing sessions. Some students received the same form of the test each time they were tested while others received alternate forms of the test. The results indicated that the subjects did experience an increase in verbal mean I.Q. In the nonverbal results, only groups retested with the same form of the test experienced significant mean gains. The verbal mean gains appeared to result from a practice effect while the nonverbal results appeared to result from students remembering specific items from one testing session to the next. (Author)

AB  - This article discusses two reports on mathematics achievement results and factors affecting student achievement, based on data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessment of mathematics. The report, Mathematics Achievement and Classroom Instructional Activities: NAEP 1985-1986, draws relationship between instructional activities and mathematics achievement pointing out that daily exposure to traditional instruction, such as working mathematics problems alone, doing mathematics homework or working from a textbook, is associated with higher achievement; such exposure is more helpful to learning how to compute and mathematics terms than it is to problem solving or forming concepts; computer use enhances math scores, particularly for eleventh grades; and Whites has significantly higher achievement than African Americans or Hispanics, even when the number of mathematics courses taken was held constant. The same is true for eleventh-grade boys on several aspects of achievement, compared to girls who had taken the same number of mathematics courses. Another report, NAEP Mathematics Subscales and Math Learning Attitudes Factors, looked at the relations between student attitudes and achievement levels.

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of the Word Learning Strategies (WLS) supplementary program designed to develop upper-elementary students' vocabulary skills in order to improve reading comprehension. The study used a true, group-randomized, experimental design, which randomly assigned 46 4th grade classrooms (n=1324 students) from 12 districts to a treatment or control group. The results from the first cohort indicate that the program was positively associated with gains in students' vocabulary learning as measured by Word Learning Strategies Test and in students' reading comprehension as measured by Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, after accounting for differences in baseline test scores. The use of the WLS program also led to increases in teachers' awareness of strategies to support their students' vocabulary and reading comprehension.

AB  - Drawing on the programme for international student assessment 2009 US data-set, this study examines the relationship between formative assessment and students’ reading achievement using a structural equation modelling approach. We find that formative assessment is positively related to students’ reading achievement directly and indirectly (through teacher–student relationship and attitude towards reading) for all students. The direct relationship between formative assessment and reading achievement is significantly stronger for Black students than for White students, whether or not student socio-economic status (SES), gender and school mean SES are controlled for. The total relationship (the direct plus the indirect relationship) between formative assessment and reading achievement also appears to be stronger for Black students than for White students; however, the difference is not statistically significant whether or not we control for covariates. No significant difference is found between White and Hispanic students in terms of the direct and the total relationship between formative assessment and reading achievement. Using a nationally representative data-set, this study provides empirical evidence that formative assessment is positively related to students’ reading achievement in general. In addition, this study provides preliminary evidence to show the potential of formative assessment to help reduce achievement gaps between Black and White students. The implications and limitations of the study are also discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of creative-map instructional strategies on learning performance, learning motivation, and creativity in a junior high school geography class. A quasi-experimental approach was used to assess the treatment effects among 79 ninth graders, utilizing qualitative data including students' feedback, and four quantitative instruments: filling-in map quizzes, geography term exams, the Learning Motivation Scale for Primary and Junior High School Students, and the Newly Revised Creative Thinking Tests. Repeated-measures ANCOVA were performed to analyze the correlation coefficients between the experimental and control groups, and indicated that the former group performed better than the latter in learning performance, motivation, and creativity after the intervention. Thus, it can be concluded that creative-map mnemonic strategies can have a positive impact on the learning and retention of place names and locations. Implications for further research and practice are also discussed.

AB  - The present study employed a difference-in-difference approach to determine the impact of a technologically enhanced diagnostic and formative assessment system implemented in one US state in kindergarten through third grade on school-level end-of-year third-grade reading test scores and percentage of students receiving special education services. Data were obtained for 795 elementary schools that implemented the assessment system in a staggered progression across multiple years. The analysis estimated the effect of the assessment system on the entire third-grade sample, and by selected demographic characteristics. Results showed no effect of the assessment system on average end-of-year reading scores or school-level percentage of students receiving special education services. Follow-up models including time and fidelity information also obtained null results overall. Given the null, schools should consider modifications to the ways they obtain, manage, and use assessment data.

AB  - Research has consistently shown memory is enhanced when learning combines test trials with study trials compared with study trials alone (i.e., testing effect). However, the majority of work on testing effects has involved undergraduate students. In the current experiment, the authors examined testing effects in 2 groups of elementary school children. First and 3rd graders learned 1 list of words in a test-plus-restudy condition and a 2nd list of words in a restudy condition. In addition to examining the benefits of testing in children, the authors examined possible explanations for the memorial benefits of testing that have received initial support in adult populations (Zaromb & Roediger, 2010). Results showed that the benefits of testing extend to elementary school children and that testing enhanced item-specific processing but not relational processing. Third graders were also aware of the memorial benefits of testing, whereas 1st graders were not. Most important, even 1st graders benefit from testing, in part because testing allows them to capitalize on their ability to process item-specific information.

AB  - This book chapter reports a study designed to examine the effectiveness of an English-language ER program for remedial students at a public secondary school in the southern Philippines. Sixty first-year students at the school, 30 females and 30 males, who were to be assigned to remedial reading classes constituted the participants in this study. Using a matched-pairs design, each student was first matched with another of similar IQ, sex, socio-economic status, reading level, and past achievement. Then, one member of each pair was randomly assigned to the experimental remedial reading class, and the other member was assigned to the control class, so as to achieve balance on the variables in the two remedial reading classes. A Pre-test-Post-test Control Group design was used. The dependent variable, reading proficiency, was assessed via two instruments: the Informal Reading Inventory (IRI) (Johnson, Kress, & Pikulski, 1987), which yields scores from 0-100 on reading comprehension, and the Gray Standardized Oral Reading Test (GSORT) (Gray, 1967), which measures reading speed and accuracy, and indicates the grade level at which the student is reading. Both instruments were administered twice, once two months before the six-month treatment began and again after the treatment had been carried out. During the six months, both the control and experimental groups received 40 minutes of regular English class daily, plus an additional 40-minute remedial reading class. In their remedial reading class, the control group was taught in the conventional way from a textbook which included lessons on vowel and consonant sounds, minimal pairs, reading and reciting poems, and reading short selections. The only silent reading the control group did - and this infrequently - was of these short selections from their textbook. In contrast, the experimental remedial reading group took part in an ER program, the core of which consisted of students reading texts of their choice and doing a variety of post-reading activities. Post-test scores showed that the treatment group outperformed their control group peers to a statistically significant extent. [This article appears as a chapter in Y. M. Cheah & S. M.

AB  - The Ministry of Education abolished the joint entrance examination and adopted a multi-channel entrance program for high schools and junior college in 2001, hoping to ease junior high school students' entrance-exam-related stress. The paper uses the Taiwan Youth Project in 2000, which surveyed 7th and 9th grade students who applied to the new and old entrance systems respectively to examine the effects of the program on students' entrance-exam-related stress, daily schedule, extracurricular activities, and art and talent performance. Results show that after the implementation of the program, the students' entrance-exam-related stress is amplified. They also have a busier schedule than they used to. Moreover, using the adoption of the program in 2001, this paper applies a differences-in-difference method to examine its effects on extracurricular activities and art and talent performance. This paper uses students applying to the old entrance system as the comparison group, and students applying to the new entrance system as the treatment group. Results indicate that the program leads to students doing more extracurricular activities and art and talent performance.

AB  - Today’s educators are faced with growing academic accountability demands coupled with the increasing demands for preparing students for a technology-driven workplace. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine the extent to which the use of the Classroom Performance System (CPS) impacted social studies performance among a group of students in a rural southeastern U.S. elementary school. The CPS is a student response system which uses wireless connectivity. Constructivist theory provided a framework for examining the impact of the use of CPS on Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) scores. Constructivists believe knowledge is gained through previous experiences which spans new knowledge. Therefore, all students participating in this study were familiar with using the CPS, and prior knowledge of the CPS was assumed. The sample for this study consisted of 57 fourth graders and 40 fifth graders who were divided into a test group and a control group. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze CRCT data. Results of the implementation of the CPS showed a decrease in the domains of geography and core skills with no significant change in the scale score and domain of civics; however, there was improvement in the domains of economics and history. The findings of this study may assist school administrators in making decisions regarding the incorporation of the CPS into teachers’ classrooms. Additionally, teachers may benefit from CPS implementation by making more informed decisions regarding technology infusion into the classroom.

AB  - The efficacy of home notes has been extensively documented across decades of research for improving classroom behavior, academic skills, and home-school communication. However, when used in traditional paper form, home notes may be forged, lost, or destroyed. More recently, there has been increased interest in web- and technology-based interventions due to increased feasibility, accessibility, and efficiency. However, more research is needed in this area. The purpose of the current study was to replicate and extend Knorr's (2015) research evaluating the effectiveness of an Electronic Daily School Note intervention package for improving on-task behavior, math performance, and home-school collaboration. A multiple-probe, multiple-baseline single-subject design was used. The study was conducted in one public elementary school serving predominantly low-income ethnic minority students. Participants included four males in either the fourth or fifth grade who were referred by their teacher for having lower rates of on-task behavior and math performance as compared to classroom peers. During the intervention phase, participants' on-task behavior and parent review of the Electronic Daily School Note were contingently reinforced. Results indicate that the Electronic Daily School Note intervention package produced large increases in participant on-task behavior (Tau-U = .90; IRD = .88), which were maintained at a three-week follow-up (Tau-U = .60; IRD = .49). Three of four participants' rates of on-task behavior approximated that of classroom peers during the intervention phase. Correlational coefficients between teacher ratings on the Electronic Daily School Note and data obtained via direct observation were at or above .70 and significant at the .05 level. Participants demonstrated medium to large increases in math problem completion (Tau-U = .65; IRD = .67) and large increases in accuracy (Tau-U = .70; IRD = .71) on curriculum-based math worksheets. However, these effects were maintained for only one participant at three weeks follow-up. Parents reviewed Electronic Daily School Note data with their child 84% of the time. The intervention had high parent and student acceptability. Teacher social validity ratings were mixed. All parents and teachers reported the Electronic Daily School Note intervention package improved their home-school collaboration. Study limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Gaining an accurate understanding of variables is one challenge many students face when learning algebra. Prior research has shown that a significant number of students hold misconceptions about variables and that misconceptions impede learning. Yet, teachers do not have access to diagnostic tools that can help them determine the misconceptions about variables that their students harbor. Therefore, a formative assessment for variable misconceptions was created and administered to 437 middle- and high-school students. Analyses from the test scores were found to exhibit strong reliability, predictive validity, and construct validity in addition to important developmental trends. Both teachers and researchers can use the test to identify students who hold misconceptions about variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We compared weekly quizzes in extended-matching format with multiple-choice questions and oral examinations as means of monitoring students' progress in gross anatomy. Students' performance on 19 weekly oral examinations or 10-question quizzes based on extended-matching or multiple-choice formats were correlated with their success on 3 interim examinations and the final comprehensive examination. The Kuder-Richardson formula 20, an estimate of precision of the test, was 0.64 for extended-matching quizzes. Students' performance on interim examinations did not differ significantly. There was a significant correlation between students' mean scores on weekly quizzes and mean scores on interim examinations in both the extended-matching (r=0.516) and multiple-choice group (r=0.823). The mean grades (ranging from 2 to 5) on the final exam. based on understanding of anatomical concepts and their application in clinical practice, were significantly higher in extended-matching group (4.8) than in the multiple-choice (4.1) and orally examined groups (3.9) (p<0.05). We conclude that extended-matching quizzes were at least as effective as multiple-choice quizzes and oral examinations and may be better for acquiring synthetic understanding of anatomical concepts especially in combination with other means of knowledge assessment. We recommend them as a reliable and objective means of monitoring students' performance during a gross anatomy course.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a significant relationship between repeated test taking on the SAT and several demographic measures. These measures included ethnicity (American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Mexican/Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Other Hispanic/Latino/Latin American, White, Other, and Unreported); gender (male, female, unreported); need for financial aid (yes, no, unknown, unreported); or high school location (large city, medium-sized city, small city or town, suburban, rural, and unreported) for North Carolina State University applicants between 2003 and 2008. An additional goal was to investigate the implications the new SAT reporting option, Score Choice, could have on future applicants' scores. The study examined SAT scores submitted to North Carolina State University between 2003 and 2008 for its applicants, totaling 151,901 individual SAT scores. Overall, this study found there was a significant statistical relationship between repeatedly taking the SAT and ethnicity, gender, need for financial aid, and high school location. Furthermore, it found that the new SAT reporting policy, Score Choice, could indeed impact North Carolina State University undergraduate applicants' scores. On average, there was a within-person change in student SAT scores over time when looking at the North Carolina State University applicant pool between 2003 and 2008. Additionally, there was not a disadvantage to taking the SAT multiple times, as on average scores did not decrease across the selected population. This indicated that the more times students took the SAT, the greater the potential to increase their score. The findings also indicated that there were differences in whether students' scores increased with each additional attempt of the SAT based on ethnic background, gender, and need for financial aid. The SAT score that students would report through Score Choice was found to be related to ethnicity, gender, financial aid, and location of a student's high school. A paired samples t test revealed a statistically reliable difference between the score a student reports using Score Choice (the highest combination of math and verbal scores during one sitting) and the combination of an applicant's highest scores from each portion of the SAT to obtain the highest possible final SAT score ("superscore"). Therefore, it appears that the practice of taking the highest math and highest verbal score across all sittings of the SAT is the more beneficial to a student than the score submitted by Score Choice.

AB  - Examined effects of different testing frequencies upon performance in algebra and spatial geometry of 28 11th graders in China. Ss were matched according to their previous average academic achievement, then divided into experimental and control groups. After an intervention of informal oral testing for the experimental Ss in one semester, all Ss were given a mathematical abilities test and an informal interview. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out to analyze the differences in performance between the 2 groups. Results showed statistically significant differences in favor of the experimental group. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the groups differed significantly in spatial geometry. Findings suggest that frequent informal oral tests can benefit students in their problem-solving skills in geometry. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A longitudinal study of the effects of an early childhood mathematics intervention was conducted in 2 private elementary schools in a large city in central Texas. The study included 377 participants in prekindergarten through fifth grades. Explicit non-inverted number names were taught in English and Spanish to prekindergarten and kindergarten students, with formative assessments conducted during this timeframe. Summative assessment results from standardized achievement tests were collected in grades 1 through 5 from 341 of the participants. Normal curve equivalent scores of total mathematics achievement, problem solving, and mathematics procedures were compared among groups of children with no or up to 2 academic years of experience using explicit non-inverted number names. Children in Grade 1 who had no experience with the intervention, scored significantly higher than the other children in mathematics procedures. After the first grade, a means trend emerged, showing children with the most experience demonstrated higher overall mean scores within the three measures. In Grade 3, children with the most experience using the intervention demonstrated significantly higher scores in mathematics procedures.

AB  - In research on teaching and learning, formative assessments are considered to be an effective method of improving student performance. However, the effects vary strongly depending on learning content, diagnostic procedures, and the form of feedback. In a randomized experimental study conducted in biology classes, it was thus examined whether in the case of a computer-based, formative achievement test detailed in-depth feedback (treatment 1) would lead to better learning results than simple feedback (treatment 2). In a control group, students read the identical texts. 10 forms with a total of 261 students attending classes on the lower secondary level participated in the study. Results show that students receiving simple feedback achieve better results in both the post-test and the test of knowledge retained than students receiving treatment 1 or students of the control group. However, when looking more closely at the use made of the feedback, positive achievement effects can be shown for students getting in-depth feedback, too, compared to the control group.

AB  - The passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004) has brought considerable support in law for the use of a response-to-intervention (RTI) process utilizing an array of scientific and researched-based procedures to determine if and how students respond to specific changes in instruction. RTI is often used within a problem-solving model to identify effective instructional or intervention strategies and to evaluate their effectiveness. An essential component of problem-solving and evidence-based practices is the use of progress-monitoring data to inform and guide educational decision making. Consistent with best practice, the use of highly structured, precise, and empirically validated progress-monitoring procedures can lead to improved student outcomes (Fuchs, 1986). However, progress-monitoring procedures are not typically developed or used for determining intervention effectiveness, or students' response to intervention. A major goal of this study was to determine the impact of training and the role of a structured problem-solving approach in promoting the quality of progress-monitoring procedures. A second purpose of this study was to examine the impact that the quality of progress-monitoring procedures had on student outcomes. Results indicate that participants who received training in the problem-solving process developed progress-monitoring procedures of higher overall quality as compared to control school participants. When examining the impact of training in problem solving and the quality of progress-monitoring procedures on the academic and behavioral outcomes of students, there were no statistically significant differences between the control and treatment schools. However, case-by-case examination of data showed more students in the treatment school to achieve greater progress as measured by goal attainment scaling (GAS). Students from the treatment school made greater academic and behavioral gains using GAS compared to rating scales. In comparison to prereferral teams at the treatment school developing behavioral goals, teams developing academic goals achieved relatively higher scores on the Progress-Monitoring Procedural Coding Scheme, and had more students make significant improvements toward academic goals as measured by GAS relative change scores.

AB  - School systems across the nation have adopted policies that reward or sanction particular schools on the basis of their students' performance on standardized math and reading tests. One of the most frequently raised concerns regarding such "high-stakes testing" policies is that they oblige schools to focus on subjects for which they are held accountable, but to neglect the rest. Many have worried that the limited focus of these policies could have an unintended negative effect on student proficiency in other subjects, such as science, that are important to the development of human capital and thus to future economic growth. This paper evaluates whether the F-grade sanction in Florida's A+ program has led schools to increase student learning in the high-stakes subjects of math and reading to the detriment of learning in the important, but low-stakes subject of science. Results indicate that the F-grade sanction led to substantial student gains in the learning of math, reading, and science. Finally, a simple model is produced to explain the impact of high-stakes testing on student learning in low-stakes subjects. Evidence is provided suggesting that virtually all the positive findings in science are attributable to complementarities in the learning of math and reading. (Contains 2 tables and 3 endnotes.)

AB  - With the assistance of East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, the Indianola Public Schools in Oklahoma developed a computerized curriculum management system (CMS) to aid in curricular planning and evaluation. Using CMS, teachers can implement findings associated with the effective schools research by delineating and communicating the goals and objectives of instruction, by encouraging high expectations for student achievement, by emphasizing basic skills, and by continuously monitoring student progress. CMS uses the Annehurst Curricular Classification System (ACCS) which contains approximately 60,000 learning outcomes in mathematics, science, language arts and social studies. Materials designed to teach the curricular content were entered into CMS data banks. Activities can also be coded by learning modalities. Students are placed in the scope and sequence of the curriculum based on the results of criterion referenced tests. CMS generates a 2-week individualized plan of study for each student, detailing the objectives and the activities. At the end of the 2-week period, the students are tested, and CMS produces a report to teachers and parents. The system is also designed to evaluate learning activities based on teacher rating and student performance. CMS enables public school and university faculty to collaborate through shared data banks which can be monitored at university sites. This facilitates remediating curricular problems, as well as conducting research. During the 1988-89 academic year, CMS was field-tested using 120 students in the mathematics curriculum. A pretest-posttest study of composite mathematics achievement scores found a gain of 14 percentile points. (KS)

AB  - This quasi-experiment using a pretest-posttest with control group design investigated the effects of providing immediate feedback using an electronic student response system (SRS) to 53 math students enrolled in an accelerated precalculus course during the fall semester of 2014. The students in the experiment group (n = 25) went through a continuous, rigorous, and consistent intervention of receiving immediate feedback for their responses during regular classroom activities and formative assessments using SRS, while the students in the control group (n = 28) were not provided immediate feedback using student response system. The results of the pretest indicated that both groups had statistically significant similar entry-level math skills. The analysis of other covariates in this study, namely giftedness, gender, and economic status of the participating students, were also found to be significantly homogenous. Following an 18-week intervention, after the data were found to meet all the assumptions, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted that revealed a statistically significant difference in the math achievement of students who received immediate feedback using SRS with a medium effect size (n2 ...11). Even though the results proved acceptable, various limitations might have incurred in this study. Therefore, recommendations included further research on the effects of providing immediate feedback with varied samples, longer intervention period, and improved technological devices to provide guidelines for informed decision making regarding the use of SRS as an immediate feedback tool.

AB  - Governments worldwide use standardized tests to address educational deficiencies and improve public accountably and quality of education in their countries. In South Africa the Department of Basic Education resorted to standardized testing as an option to respond to the public outcry about the quality of education in the country. This article explores the use of standardized tests to hold schools accountable. The primary purpose of standardized tests is to inform teaching and improve learning. Assessment is about constructive learning processes and to provide useful feedback to learners, parents and teachers. Researchers however warn of the unintended consequences of high-stakes tests, which include the narrowing of the curriculum and an excessive emphasis on test preparation. This study sought to determine the impact of standardized tests popularly known as annual national assessments (in South Africa) on the classroom practice.

AB  - The intense focus on standards and accountability is rapidly altering the education environment. Often the gauge for measuring school effectiveness is performance on high-stake state tests. In this retrospective cohort comparison study, I observe the relation between the use of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) for reading and change on a state test for reading after implementation of systematic decision making (SDM). Over a span of three years, two student cohorts in two elementary schools were observed. In each two-year cohort, students began in third and then moved to fourth grade: Cohort One (2009-2011) and Cohort Two (2010-2012). Both cohorts participated in fall, winter, and spring [F-W-S] benchmark screening for Passage Reading Fluency (PRF) and took a state test. Additionally, during the 2011-2012 academic year, SDM was implemented for Cohort Two using reading CBMs. This study addressed three questions: (a) What is the affect on reading growth (OAKS-Reading) in the context of SDM with CBMs? (b) What is the correlation between [F-W-S] PRF and OAKS Reading? and (c) What is the relation between within-year growth rates for students at risk and not at risk in the context of SDM with CBMs? I used an independent samples t-test to examine the across year change in reading for both cohorts (OAKS-Reading) to determine whether the implementation of SDM resulted in a significant difference between cohorts. For Cohort Two (using a SDM model), I correlated benchmark screening within-year measures (easyCBM) and OAKS Reading. Finally, I calculated growth rates for at-risk and not-at-risk students within a SDM model to examine whether that model demonstrated evidence of accelerated growth in at-risk students relative to their not-at-risk peers. Results did not indicate a strong relation between SDM and the large-scale, outcome assessment (OAKS-Reading). A Pearson product-moment correlation indicated a strong positive correlation between the formative measure PRF and the large-scale, outcome assessment OAKS-Reading. Results showed both risk categories had accelerated growth in reading fluency between fall and winter compared to between winter and spring. Implications for school practice and research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - Test-enhanced learning refers to the fact that taking an initial test on studied material enhances its later retention relative to simply studying the material and then taking a final test. Most research on the testing effect has been done with materials such as word lists, and the general finding has been that the benefits of testing are greater when the initial test is a recall (production) test rather than are cognition test. We briefly summarize three experiments that extend these results to educationally relevant materials, namely brief articles, lectures, and materials in a college course. All three experiments demonstrated a robust testing effect and also revealed that an initial short-answer test produced greater gains on a final test than did an initial multiple-choice test. Further more, one experiment revealed a positive effect of immediate feedback given with the initial test. The educational implications are that production tests (short answer or essay) and feed back soon after learning increase learning and retention. In addition, frequent testing probably has the indirect positive effects of keeping students motivated and leading them to space out periods of study.

AB  - Many thousands of students take standardized tests every year. In the current research, we asked whether answering standardized test questions affects students' later test performance. Prior research has shown both positive and negative effects of multiple-choice testing on later tests, with negative effects arising from students selecting incorrect alternatives on multiple-choice tests and then believing they were correct (Roediger & Marsh, 2005). In the current experiments, undergraduates and high school students answered multiple-choice questions retired from SAT II tests (that are no longer in the testing pool) on biology, chemistry, U.S. history, and world history, and later answered cued-recall questions about these subjects. In 3 experiments, we observed positive testing effects: More final cued-recall questions were answered correctly if the items had appeared on the initial multiple-choice test. We also sometimes observed negative testing effects: intrusions of multiple-choice distractors as answers on the final cued-recall test. Students who scored well on the initial test benefited from taking the test, but lower achieving students showed either less benefit (undergraduates) or costs from the testing (high school students).

AB  - A large literature shows that retrieval practice is a powerful tool for enhancing learning and memory in undergraduates (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Much less work has examined the memorial consequences of testing school-aged children. Our focus is on multiple-choice tests, which are potentially problematic since they minimise retrieval practice and also expose students to errors (the multiple-choice lures). To examine this issue, second graders took a multiple-choice general knowledge test (e.g., What country did the Pilgrims come from: England, Germany, Ireland, or Spain?) and later answered a series of short answer questions, some of which corresponded to questions on the earlier multiple-choice test. Without feedback, the benefits of prior testing outweighed the costs for easy questions. However, for hard questions, the large increase in multiple-choice lure answers on the final test meant that the cost of prior testing outweighed the benefits when no feedback was provided. This negative testing effect was eliminated when children received immediate feedback (consisting of the correct answer) after each multiple-choice selection. Implications for educational practice are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A continuous pupil progress monitoring system was implemented in two elementary schools; 552 students and 38 educational personnel were involved. The monitoring system employed was initially designed to evaluate students receiving special services and their progress toward individual education plan reading goals. The model emphasized direct assessment in the students' grade level basal reader (Ginn Reading Series) and repeated measurement of the number of words read correctly in students' 1-minute readings for 16 weeks. The number of words read correctly by the student was tabulated and the information entered into a microcomputer program. A computer printout displayed a graph of each student's performance and a summary of descriptive statistics (baseline level, current level, average weekly gain or loss, and amount of variability in reading scores). Actual time for administration and scoring was approximately 3 minutes per student. Teachers generally felt that the information collected was instructionally relevant. The extent to which student performance data were valid indices of student achievement, were sensitive to pupil growth, and could be used to judge the efficacy of program placement and student progress in the program also were examined. Results suggest that the system can be implemented successfully on a wide-scale basis in schools. (Author/PN)

AB  - This study examined the impact of repeated testing and teachers' effects on student achievement in a remedial mathematics course. A 2 x 2 completely randomised factorial design was used, with final examination performance the dependent variable and testing attempts and the teacher factor the independent variables. The study found no main effects for teacher but a main effect for testing attempts and a teacher-factor/testing-attempt interaction. Post hoc findings qualified a direct interpretation of the main effect. The implications for further research and application are discussed. giving special attention to teacher effects, the needs of remedial mathematics instruction, and the claims of mastery-learning pedagogies.

AB  - The current study examines the technical adequacy of four Early Numeracy Curriculum-Based Measurement (EN-CBM) screening tasks: "Oral Counting" (OC), "Number Identification" (NI), "Quantity Discrimination" (QD), and "Missing Number" (MN). Results from 59 kindergarten students assessed in the fall and spring reveal moderate to high test-retest and delayed alternate-form reliability. In addition, data from the four measures demonstrate adequate concurrent and predictive validity by comparing them to an established measure of early numeracy. The measures demonstrated growth over time from the beginning to the end of kindergarten. Finally, combinations of the measures were evaluated post hoc, and the combination of NI, QD, and MN produced the highest reliability, validity, and rate of growth coefficients. Overall, results support the technical adequacy of EN-CBM for use with kindergarten-aged children. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This study was an assessment of the impact of assessment frequency on second grade English Learner (EL) performance on Common Core State Standards (CCSS)-aligned Benchmark assessments. The impact of assessment frequency was observed for 65 students in the study who were placed in one of three groups. The first experimental group (Group A) was administered and two researcher created CCSS-aligned classroom assignments before the summative benchmark at the end of the school year. The second experimental group (Group B) was administered with one researcher-created assessment before the summative benchmark at the end of the school year. The third group (Group C) served as the control group, taking no assessments. Results indicated a drop in mean scores for all students in the study from their first two district benchmark assessments (B1 and B2, respectively) to their researcher-created assessments (CA and CB, respectively). This trend continued for the summative benchmark (B3). ANOVA was not performed on this body of data due to these results, but the data set sparked additional considerations for assessment development and future areas for research. Areas of discussion include standardizing assessments in a consistent manner throughout the school district with appropriate teams and assessment protocols. Future research can focus on longitudinal research to evaluate assessment frequency for students in years when they take state assessments, such as the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), also known as Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, or SBAC.

AB  - Replication studies in special education are necessary to strengthen the foundation upon which instruction and intervention for students with disabilities are built. J. Jenkins et al. (2017) found intermittent reading fluency progress monitoring schedules did not delay decision-making and were similar in decision-making accuracy to the traditional weekly progress monitoring schedule. Results of the current pilot study, although underpowered, conceptually replicated the original claims and extended their work by investigating their questions in the area of mathematics computation. Implications for research and practice are shared.

AB  - As part of a series of annual evaluations of the knowledge, understanding, skills, and attitudes of Massachusetts public-school students, this report represents the assessment of basic skills attainment of grade 12 students. The first three chapters contain a summary of the design and methodology of the testing program. The remaining five chapters present the results of the student questionnaire, the principal questionnaire, and the achievement test results in mathematics, reading, and writing for the tests as a whole and for the items separately. A two-stage stratified cluster design was used to select a representative sample of students in grade 12 from six geographic areas and four kinds of communities: big cities, industrial suburbs, residential suburbs, and other communities. Each student was administered one of the three tests. (Author/CTM)

AB  - The predictive utility of screening measures for forecasting math disability (MD) at the end of 2nd grade and the predictive and discriminant validity of math progress-monitoring tools were assessed. Participants were 225 students who entered the study in 1st grade and completed data collection at the end of 2nd grade. Screening measures were Number Identification/Counting, Fact Retrieval, Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) Computation, and CBM Concepts/Applications. For Number Identification/Counting and CBM Computation, 27 weekly assessments were also collected. MD was defined as below the 10th percentile at the end of 2nd grade on calculations and word problems. Logistic regression showed that the 4-variable screening model produced good and similar fits in accounting for MD-calculation and MD-word problems. Classification accuracy was driven primarily by CBM Concepts/Applications and CBM Computation; CBM Concepts/Applications was the better of these predictors. CBM Computation, but not Number Identification/Counting, demonstrated validity for progress monitoring.

A quasi-experimental interrupted time-series approach using Bayesian hierarchical growth curve analysis with crossed random effects is used to compare the annual gains in test performance of students attending America's Choice schools to those of students attending other Rochester schools and to those of students attending America's Choice schools before they adopted this CSR model. Findings reveal significant annual effects, which accumulate over time, in elementary and middle grades reading and mathematics. (Contains 6 tables, 7 figures and 9 notes.)

A total of 11 fourth graders with a history of low achievement in arithmetic were divided into two groups and given timed arithmetic tests daily. Three reinforcement conditions were used (immediate, 1-day delay, and 1-week delay) with the sequence of delay conditions being reversed for one of the groups. Results indicated that the rate of increase in correct problem solving decreased as the reinforcement delay increased, and that the percentage of problems solved correctly increased as the reinforcement delay increased.

AB  - This study examined the effects of cooperative testing versus traditional or individual testing and the impacts on academic achievement, motivation toward science, and study time for 9th grade biology students. Research questions centered on weekly quizzes given in a flipped classroom format for a period of 13 weeks. The study used a mixed methods research design, which combined quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques. The study examined 66 students enrolled in three sections of a 9th grade biology course at a private K-12 school. Students were randomly assigned to groups of three or four students. Weekly quizzes on regularly assigned curriculum material were provided from the flipped classroom videos. Six quizzes were randomly selected for each class to be in the cooperative testing format and six quizzes were randomly selected to be given individually or traditional-style testing format. Week 7 was reserved for administration of the mid-study questionnaire and no quiz was administered. Quantitative data collected included student grades on the 12 weekly quizzes. Qualitative data were also collected from pre-study, mid-study, and post-study questionnaires as well as semi-structured individual interviews and one focus group. Cooperative testing groups scored higher on the quizzes than when students took quizzes as individuals for five of the nine quizzes analyzed. Students did not score significantly higher than the best scorer in groups taking quizzes individually. For one quiz, the best scorer did better than the cooperative groups. Overall, cooperatively tested groups in some cases scored higher than the average of groups taking the quizzes individually, but the impact was not consistent across all quiz weeks. Difficulty level of the material, contextual factors, and ceiling effects are among potential explanations of the inconsistent outcomes. Across the study, motivation toward science stayed the same or increased depending on the aspect of motivation examined. Student attitudes of cooperative testing, group functioning, and overall satisfaction were positive throughout the study. The student responses indicated they found the experience in cooperative testing beneficial to their own learning process and relevant for future career success. Study time was consistent throughout the study and corresponded to the length of the video lesson each week.

AB  - Reported is a study which formed part of the development of a conceptually oriented curriculum in elementary science. A new approach to the introduction of concepts of energy was presented at the second grade level (three second-grade classrooms). A sequence of five lessons, in audiotutorial format, covering energy concepts selected, were developed, trial-tested, revised and then presented at weekly intervals. Tests were developed to assess meaningful learning. Two picture tests were administered to the entire sample, one week apart, following the end of instruction. The first was readministered four weeks later. One group, randomly selected, had six individual interviews (approximately 15 minutes long). Two interviews were non-science to establish rapport. The next two were given following the two picture tests respectively. Scores on the tests were adjusted according to the ability of the student to justify a previous response. The final two interviews concerned new pictures and materials. Exactly half of the interview group showed satisfactory generalizability of all the basic forms of energy. Ten percent showed a satisfactory concept of energy as an entity. None showed a satisfactory concept of energy conservation. Scores corrected through interview were almost all higher than raw scores on the picture tests which suggested that these tests underestimated achievement. Test-retest reliability was 0.75.

AB  - The North Carolina Project for Reform in Science Education, which is part of the National Science Teachers Association's Scope, Sequence, and Coordination Project, and the importance of student test scores as an evaluation tool were evaluated. Seven North Carolina schools participated in the project's first year (1991-92), with 21 teachers, and about 1,600 sixth graders. The reform program called for science for 6 years for all students, fewer topics covered in mode depth, and a careful and coordinated curriculum with a hands-on approach and assessment examining understanding. Because the goals of the reformed curriculum differed from the curriculum on which the state-mandated science test was based, a method was developed to adjust test scores to allow for the difference and allow the test to be instructionally valid. The adjustment process protected project schools from uninformed decisions about project worth. Students in project schools performed slightly better than did students in control schools on subject matter taught more extensively in the project schools. Efforts to develop alternative assessments for the project schools are briefly described. Results highlight difficulties arising in using student testing as a program effectiveness summative criterion. Experiences show some legitimate formative functions that tests can serve. Appendix A contains a matrix of sixth grade goals by content area. Appendix B gives sample performance assessment item sets. (SLD)

AB  - The reality of changing state and federal policy, as well as the process of program improvement across teacher preparation programs has prompted a line of research into the exploration of an alternative curriculum-based value-added model (VAM). Based upon a thorough review of VAMs as they have been applied to education policy and decision-making, this line of inquiry focused on a curriculum-based approach to increasing our understanding of how the instructional efforts of our candidates affect the learning gains of the K-12 students they teach. Designed to conform to the fundamental principles of evidence-based practice, candidate and program level data for 109 student teachers between 2013 and 2017 were analyzed. Results indicate that variation in K-12 students' learning gains can likely be attributed to the instructional efforts of our special education teacher preparation program (TPP) completers. Limitations, implications, and directions for future inquiry across policy, practice, and scholarship are discussed.

AB  - 24 pupils, 6 girls and 18 boys, were selected from 100 ninth-grade students as an experimental group on the criterion that their reading ages were definitely inferior to their mental ages. These were trained daily for nine weeks in reading using exercises 'similar to those used by Stella Center in 1935 in a federal reading project at Roosevelt High School, New York City.' Half the class improved a grade or more and two-thirds a half-grade or more in reading achievement as measured by two standardized tests. Since improvement in reading bore no apparent relation to mental age it is concluded that 'a repetition of this study could better serve the school if ninth-grade pupils of low reading age, regardless of mental ages within the range of twelve and above, were selected as subjects.'

AB  - Typically, teachers use tests to evaluate students' knowledge acquisition. In a novel experimental study, we examined whether low-stakes testing ("quizzing") can be used to foster students' learning of course content in 8th grade science classes. Students received multiple-choice quizzes (with feedback); in the quizzes, some target content that would be included on the class summative assessments was tested, and some of the target content was not tested. In Experiment 1, three quizzes on the content were spaced across the coverage of a unit. Quizzing produced significant learning benefits, with between 13% and 25% gains in performance on summative unit examinations. In Experiments 2a and 2b, we manipulated the placement of the quizzing, with students being quizzed on some content prior to the lecture, quizzed on some immediately after the lecture, and quizzed on some as a review prior to the unit exam. Review quizzing produced the greatest increases in exam performance, and these increases were only slightly augmented when the items had appeared on previous quizzes. The benefits of quizzing (relative to not quizzing) persisted on cumulative semester and end-of-year exams. We suggest that the present effects reflect benefits accruing to retrieval practice, benefits that are well established in the basic literature. (Contains 10 tables.)

AB  - In educational learning contexts, unlike typical contemporary laboratory paradigms, students have repeated opportunities to study and learn target material, thereby potentially allowing different sequences of testing and studying. We investigated learning and retention after several plausible sequences that were patterned on a classic memory paradigm. After initially reading a research methods text, 2 days later in 1 condition participants repeatedly restudied the material 3 times (SSS), in another condition they engaged in a test-restudy-test sequence (TST), and in a third condition participants repeatedly tested on the studied material (3 times: TTT). Participants received a final test 5 days later. In Experiment 1, both TST and TTT produced better final performance than did SSS; however, TST was not better than TTT. In Experiment 2 the TST condition was altered so that after the first test, correct/incorrect feedback was provided and the test and feedback were available during the study phase. With this protocol, TST produced better learning and retention than did TTT or SSS. These findings suggest possible critical aspects regarding test feedback and the availability of previous tests for helping students to optimize their restudy efforts after low- or no-stakes quizzes.

AB  - "Check, Connect, and Expect" (CCE) is a secondary tier behavioral intervention that provides students with levels of support including a dedicated "coach" for check-in and check-out procedures, and social skills instruction. Elementary students (n = 22) in an alternative education school setting received CCE for 13 weeks following 4 weeks of baseline data collection. Measures included (a) daily progress reports (DPR), (b) direct observation of academic engagement, and (c) curriculum-based measures of academic growth (math calculation and oral reading fluency). These measures were used to examine the relationship between CCE and student outcomes using an interrupted time series design and multilevel growth curve modeling. This quasi-experimental within-subjects design compared the slopes and intercepts of baseline student data with intervention student data. Results demonstrate that students displayed statistically significant improvement on DPRs at the onset of CCE and demonstrated positive behavioral growth during CCE. There was also a statistically significant improvement of academic engagement at the onset of CCE. There was no statistically significant change in academic performance. A description of potential moderating variables, future research directions, and practical significance is presented.

AB  - This descriptive, quantitative study examined the effects of participation in a 1-year Early Start Preschool Program for 4-year-olds in a state that requires annual testing at the end of select grades. This study focused primarily on achievement through grade 3. As no study has evaluated the effectiveness of the program, this research examined whether it has positively affected the results of the end-of-year tests. The predictor variable for this study was participation in the Early Start preschool program. For this study, the only 2 groups assessed were children who participated in Early Start and children who did not participate in the program. The criterion variables or dependent variables in this study included the state end-of-year tests for the 3rd grade in English and math from 2003 to 2005. Each group of student scores was compared using a 2 tailed t-test, and the measure of effect determined using Cohen's d statistic. The results of this study determined that this program does not positively affect achievement in English and mathematics through 3rd grade. These findings could be used to modify the program to better meet the needs of children and justifies advocacy for children through social justice by providing conclusive evidence that an academically-focused preschool program does not meet the academic needs of young children and their families.

AB  - Abstract. The present study investigated the correlation and predictive value of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) procedures for performance on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program's (MEAP) fourth grade reading assessment. A 1-minute oral reading sample was used to predict MEAP performance 2 weeks later. A positive correlation was established between the two measures. The positive and negative predictive power of the reading sample was higher than the base rates of failing and passing the MEAP. This relationship has been demonstrated across 1,362 students during 8 years of MEAP testing. The results support the use of CBM for monitoring reading progress, and establishing which students are at risk for low reading skills and failing state tests.

AB  - Findings on the effects of questions on attention and achievement seem inconsistent. Perhaps the inconsistencies are related to the number of pupils who are required to make overt, interpretable responses to each question. 52 3rd-grade students were randomly assigned to 2 groups and exposed to a standard lesson with the same questions. Control Ss were called upon randomly, and all experimental Ss were asked to indicate responses to every question with a nonverbal gesture. Off-task behavior was half as frequent in the experimental group, and achievement increased dramatically. No difference was detected in Ss' responses to a Likert scale of test anxiety. Apparently questions addressed to individuals are nominal stimuli to some group members and are less effective than questions used as test-like events.

AB  - Exp 1 evaluated the Add-A-Word (AAW) Spelling Program using a multiple baseline design across 3 mildly handicapped male middle school students (aged 13 yrs to 14 yrs 3 mo). Ss' performance improved on daily spelling tests when the AAW system was implemented. Exp 2 compared the AAW spelling program to the more traditional Monday pre- and end of the week posttest spelling procedure across 6 mildly handicapped middle school students (aged 12 yrs 4 mo to 14 yrs 7 mo). Ss' overall accuracy in spelling was higher during the AAW program than during either baseline (daily testing) or the pre- and posttest systems. Ss' spelling scores were also higher during the pretest/posttest procedure than during the baseline condition. Benefits of the AAW spelling program are discussed.

AB  - Early identification and intervention for students at risk for reading failure is essential to establish the foundational skills necessary for students to become skilled readers. The focus on evidence-based practices and data-driven decision making leads educators to consider additional instructional approaches, such as formative assessment (FA) and student goal-setting (SG), as part of an intervention program to prevent reading failure. This quantitative and qualitative research study examines the effect of FA and SG on the reading achievement of students at risk for reading failure, as well as evaluates teachers' perceptions of its influence on students' learning habits, motivation toward reading tasks, and self-efficacy. Further, a review of archival special education data investigates the effect of FA and SG on the identification of students with specific learning disabilities (SLD). Additionally, survey data and summaries from a focus group discussion gathered from reading specialists about FA and SG are discussed. Overall, the analysis yielded insignificant results when examining the effect of FA and SG on students' reading achievement when comparing PSSA scores; however, closer examination of proficiency categories suggested a positive effect on reading skills. Based on the findings, significantly fewer students from the FA and SG group were identified with a SLD in reading than students instructed without an evidence-based intervention. The results from the survey and discussion group added further insight into the effects of FA and SG on reading skill acquisition. Commonly, teachers reported observing positive effects on students' achievement, learning habits, motivation toward reading tasks, and reading self-efficacy. The use of a convenience sample and archival data collected over the course of different academic school years limits the generalizability of the results from the present study. A review of archival data from the same academic year would have been more methodologically sound and produced more conclusive findings. Additionally, the results of the survey and discussion group are limited due to the small sample size and potential of respondents to respond in a socially desirable way. Therefore, further research should be conducted to examine the impact FA and SG has on students' achievement.

AB  - Two alternative explanations for the discrepancies between static and dynamic measurements were investigated. The 1st focuses on Vygotsky's learning potential theory, the 2nd considers the role of anxiety tendency during test taking. Ss were students (aged 14–17 yrs) from secondary education in the Netherlands. They were tested repeatedly in grade 3 as well as in grade 4. Two types of mathematics tests were used in a longitudinal experiment. The 1st type of test consisted of open-ended items, which Ss had to solve completely on their own. With the 2nd type of test, assistance was available to Ss during the test. The latter so-called learning test was conceived of as a dynamic testing procedure. Furthermore, a test anxiety questionnaire was administered repeatedly. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data.Apart from emotionality and worry, lack of self-confidence appears to be an important constituent of test anxiety. The learning test appears to contribute to the predictive validity of conventional tests and thus a part of Vygotsky's claims were substantiated. Moreover, the mere inclusion of a test anxiety factor into an explanatory model for the gathered data is not sufficient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Featured Application The paper proposes an application of UCB algorithm for item selection in formative assessment. The main advantage of this approach is its ease of implementation when compared to Elo and Multidimensional Item Response Theory based testing. Thus the method should be applicable in virtually any classroom where formative assessment is desired and students have access to computers or phones. Abstract There is strong support for formative assessment inclusion in learning processes, with the main emphasis on corrective feedback for students. However, traditional testing and Computer Adaptive Testing can be problematic to implement in the classroom. Paper based tests are logistically inconvenient and are hard to personalize, and thus must be longer to accurately assess every student in the classroom. Computer Adaptive Testing can mitigate these problems by making use of Multi-Dimensional Item Response Theory at cost of introducing several new problems, most problematic of which are the greater test creation complexity, because of the necessity of question pool calibration, and the debatable premise that different questions measure one common latent trait. In this paper a new approach of modelling formative assessment as a Multi-Armed bandit problem is proposed and solved using Upper-Confidence Bound algorithm. The method in combination with e-learning paradigm has the potential to mitigate such problems as question item calibration and lengthy tests, while providing accurate formative assessment feedback for students. A number of simulation and empirical data experiments (with 104 students) are carried out to explore and measure the potential of this application with positive results.

AB  - Through historical thinking, history is a science that gives meaning to sources and events and raises historical awareness. Elementary school students' results in historical understanding are very low. The aim of this research was to design a formative assessment strategy to develop and assess the substantive and procedural concepts involved in historical thinking. The strategy was implemented in four teams made up of three students with different levels of knowledge. Feedback was provided using validated rubrics across five time periods, as provided by the history syllabus for the second year of junior high school. The results show a progression of ideas for each procedural concept while using the strategy, and therefore it is concluded that it was a useful tool for achieving the planned objective. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] La historia es una ciencia que, mediante el pensar históricamente, brinda significado a las fuentes y eventos para generar conciencia histórica. Los resultados que muestran los estudiantes de educación básica en comprensión histórica son muy bajos. El objetivo de este trabajo fue diseñar una estrategia de evaluación formativa para desarrollar y evaluar los conceptos sustantivos y procedimentales del pensar históricamente; la estrategia se implementó en cuatro equipos formados por tres estudiantes que presentaban distinto nivel de conocimiento. Se brindó retroalimentación mediante el uso de rúbricas validadas a lo largo de cinco períodos históricos, señalados por el programa de historia para segundo grado de secundaria. Los resultados muestran una progresión de ideas para cada concepto procedimental a lo largo de la estrategia, por lo que se concluye que fue útil para el objetivo que fue creada.

AB  - Differences in oral reading curriculum-based measurement (R-CBM) slopes based on two commonly used progress monitoring practices in field-based data were compared in this study. Semester-specific R-CBM slopes were calculated for 150 Grade 1 and 2 students who completed benchmark (i.e., 3 R-CBM probes collected 3 times per year) and strategic (i.e., one R-CBM probe collected monthly) assessments. Slopes based on two adjacent benchmark assessments were positively correlated with slopes based on three monthly strategic assessments in the spring semester of Grade 1 but not in either Grade 2 semester, and significant differences were found between the slopes in all semesters. Consistent with another study showing that slopes are overestimated when single probes are administered per occasion, slopes were larger when based on strategic versus benchmark data in the current study, and the average discrepancies between slopes were greater-than-expected growth rates in all semesters. The current findings, based on field-based data, illustrate the impact of variations in commonly used progress monitoring procedures on the precision of calculated slope estimates.

AB  - The following study examines the relationship between state achievement assessments and curriculum-based measurements. Specifically, reading performance on the Ohio Achievement Test and curriculum-based measurement oral reading fluency scores were evaluated. Relationships were examined to determine possible predictors of future state achievement test performance. Trimester benchmarks in oral reading fluency were utilized in evaluating the reading performance of 575 students from a suburban Southwestern Ohio school district. The results indicated that curriculum-based measurements of oral reading fluency and Ohio Achievement Test reading have a strong predictive relationship. A model, utilizing the most recently administered Ohio Achievement Test and oral reading fluency scores demonstrated the strongest predictive relationship with future successful state test performance. Given the federal and state objectives focused on increasing student achievement, these findings provide schools and educators with practical methods of monitoring and predicting student success.

AB  - The use of personal technology devices such as cell phones to increase communication and productivity in the workplace has been common since the 1990s, but has been slow in moving to the classroom. The Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT) movement is part of an effort to more rapidly overcome the financial obstacle of providing individual devices for every student, often referred to as a one-to-one model of technology-aided learning, and at the same time to increase student engagement with the devices students are already using outside of school. Implementing online learning activities that engage students while collecting formative assessment data allows teachers to check understanding more efficiently and accurately. Obstacles to BYOT implementation in some schools are cost, extra time for teachers required to create online quizzes, and digital distraction becoming a hindrance to learning. This study sought to investigate the effectiveness of using BYOT to collect formative assessment data to increase student engagement and achievement. Mixed methods were selected for this study in order to assess the impact of using BYOT to administer formative assessments on student engagement and student achievement. The following research questions were explored: Is there a difference in student engagement between groups that use BYOT and groups that do not use BYOT for formative assessments? Is there a difference in student achievement between groups that use BYOT and groups that do not use BYOT for formative assessments? What are students' perceptions regarding the use of BYOT as a teaching and learning tool in the high-school setting? What are teachers' perceptions regarding the use of BYOT as a teaching and learning tool in the high-school setting? Based upon the literature review, the researcher hypothesized that formative assessments administered using BYOT would positively affect student engagement and student achievement. To investigate these questions, both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained through paper and electronically administered surveys as well as summative assessment test scores. The results of this study were positive for increasing student engagement as perceived by the students, but Student Engagement Instrument scores and unit test data found that BYOT could not be attributed to having a significant effect on student engagement and student achievement. Teacher perceptions were mixed regarding how effective the use of BYOT for formative assessments were. It did, however, collect insights into student and teacher perceptions about the use of BYOT for formative assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The use of statewide tests of student achievement as one component of accountability are certainly not new. An increasing number of states have mandated statewide testing through legislation aimed at tying financial incentives to a variety of accountability indicators including student achievement. These initiatives have generated several side effects, both positive and negative: (1) there has been a renewed interest in research on factors that influence student achievement; (2) the general public, ever-wary of tax increases, has been given a concrete measurement (however controversial) by which to gauge student success; and (3) teachers, administrators, and other professional educators have become increasingly aware of the public policy implications that quantitative data can have on schools, personnel, and school programs. As the result of a school funding equity lawsuit in the state of Tennessee, new legislation mandating revised school funding formulae and accountability procedures was implemented in 1991 for all K-12 public schools. Part of the accountability procedure includes mandated annual testing of all students in grades 2 through 8 in the areas of science, math, language arts, reading, and social studies. The goal of the Tennessee Education Improvement Act (EIA) of 1991 is to reduce variability among scores in school systems across the state regardless of socioeconomic status (equity), and to ensure that all students are progressing (or value-added) from one year to the next in each of the key subject areas. These goals are reflective of the national trend toward increased accountability in education. This research, focusing solely on the area of science, addresses the following questions: (1) is there evidence of more equity and value-added in student scores?; (2) was variability in scores decreasing?; (3) how do scores compare across years and grade levels?; and (4) what are the implications for curriculum and assessment reforms? The data set for this study consisted of scale science scores in 133 Tennessee public schools, grades 2-8, for the years 1990-1994. The null hypothesis of the investigation was that there is no difference in science scale scores across years or grade levels. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/DKM)

AB  - Standards-based grading has been adopted by schools across the United States and internationally, and relies upon formative assessments and benchmark testing to evaluate student achievement prior to standardized summative testing (Murtagh, 2013). Formative assessment in daily classroom activities can increase student motivation for learning and lead to student achievement (Iqbal, Anjum, & Anjum, 2017). Benchmark testing can inform educators on student levels of achievement and guide teaching as students move forward (Hicks, 2013). The focus of this study was to determine if formative assessment effects motivation for learning and student achievement within the context of standards-based grading which focuses on content learning without outside elements considered (Guskey & Jung, 2013). A mixed methods approach was used to gain knowledge about student achievement and motivation for learning by observing student data on benchmark achievement tests and teacher perspectives of student achievement and motivation.

AB  - The effects of two components of formative evaluation (frequency of measurement and data utilization) were compared to isolate formative evaluation components which teachers might routinely use to monitor achievement in learning disabled students. Fifty-two learning disabled and educable mentally retarded elementary students enrolled in regular class programs and receiving reading instruction in a special education resource room were randomly assigned to either a pretest non-data-based change group, a daily measurement non-data-based change group, a daily measurement data-based group, or an untreated control group. Analysis of results of oral reading data supported daily measurement and data-based changes as effective components of formative evaluation. (Author)

AB  - The effects of two components of formative evaluation, frequency of measurement and use of data, were compared. Fifty-two learning disabled and educable mentally retarded students in grades 2-6, enrolled in regular class programs and receiving reading instruction in a special education resource room, were randomly assigned to either (1) a pre-posttest non-data-based change group; (2) a daily measurement non-data-based change group; (3) a daily measurement data-based change group; or (4) an untreated control group. Four types of data were used: oral reading rate correct, oral reading rate incorrect, word meaning, and comprehension. The first three measures were derived from the Power Builder Kits (Science Research Associates); the last was taken from the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test. Group 3 had the highest oral reading correct rate, after the four week program. There were no significant group differences in word meaning or comprehension. Superior achievement occurred when teachers measured oral reading daily relative to daily goals and altered both goals and consequences, based upon student performance. The effectiveness of traditional pretests and posttests for formative evaluation was questioned. (Author/CP)

AB  - Investigated the effects on students' spelling achievement of variations in teacher assessment procedures. 80 special-education resource teachers measured 80 learning disabled 2nd–6th graders' spelling performance at a constant level to task difficulty using different measurement frequencies and different rules to interpret the data. Each teacher wrote 2 consecutive 3-wk goals for improved spelling performance for 2 sets of 100 spelling words and then measured student performance either daily or weekly by dictating randomly selected words from each 100-word list. Teachers were trained to apply either a predetermined set of decision rules or their own judgment to the data to decide if the spelling program they had implemented for the student was effective. Ineffective programs were changed or modified. Results indicate that daily measurement was significantly more effective than weekly measurement in increasing spelling achievement and that, under certain conditions, decision rules were more effective than teacher judgment in determining when to make program changes or modifications.

AB  - Direct and repeated measurement of academic performance in the curriculum is an alternative to traditional referral and assessment models used in psychoeducational evaluation. This study (with 107 intermediate grade students at high risk for learning disability) contrasted a screening and referral procedure that used weekly measurement of performance in reading, spelling, and written expression with a traditional teacher referral procedure. The groups were compared with respect to referral rate, cognitive functioning, achievement level, social behavior, sex differences, and identification as learning disabled. The number of students referred through weekly measurement was similar to those referred by teachers. In addition, the results indicated that academic achievement is almost the sole criterion used in teacher referral, although teacher-referred students appeared to be more likely to be rated as behavior problems. Finally, students referred through weekly achievement measurement were as likely to have an aptitude-achievement discrepancy as students referred by teachers. (Author/DB)

AB  - This study evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention of formative assessments with a clicker-based technology on anxiety and academic performance. We use a randomized experiment in physics education in one school in Dutch secondary education. For treated students, the formative assessments are operationalized through quizzing at the end of each physics class, where clickers enable students to respond to questions. Control students do not receive these assessments and do not use clickers, but apart from that, the classes they attend are similar. Findings from multilevel regressions indicate that the formative assessments significantly reduce anxiety in physics and improve academic performance in physics in comparison with traditional teaching. Furthermore, a mediation effect of anxiety in physics on academic performance is observed. In sum, this implies that an easy to implement technique of formative assessments can make students feel more at ease, which contributes to better educational performance.

AB  - In general terms, the aims of formative assessment are to gather and analyze information about the progress of students, with the intention of improving instruction in real time. This can also help teachers to identify those elements that students are struggling with, and therefore to determine where adjustments must be made. There are, however, some issues that must be addressed before this approach can become more widespread. In this research, and with mathematics as our specific scope, we focus on two of these issues: we present a framework to help teachers implement assessment items that are highly dynamic and flexible, but that allows them at the same time to model common misconceptions and to provide suitable feedback. Following this, we carried out an experiment to determine (i) whether the students perceived such feedback to be useful; (ii) whether they actually used it; and ultimately (iii) whether it produced a difference in their performance. To find the answers to these questions, we used an online & x2018;pre-calculus & x2019; course with 458 students and collected data directly from those students via both a perception survey and from their interaction with the LMS. Based on these data, we performed several analyses, including process mining and statistical hypothesis tests. The results demonstrated that although many of the students had a positive opinion of the feedback received, it was not always followed. Nevertheless, when it was (or at least when students said it was), the students performed better.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of self-modeling combined with self-monitoring in improving the oral reading fluency skills of six 5th grade students. Participants were reading third to fourth grade curriculum, performed between the 20th to 50th percentile on Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, and were reported to be 'word for word' readers by their teacher. Pre- and Postcurriculum-Based Assessment (CBA) probes were utilized to determine the participants' reading instructional level. Results of these probes determined the reading goals of the participants and were used to develop Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) probes to monitor reading skills during the study. A pre- and postreading assessment was conducted to determine the students' reading skills. The students were then videotaped reading CBM probes twice a week during the baseline and intervention phases. A CBA screening session tape and all intervention tapes were edited and shown to the participants during all intervention phases. The videotapes were edited to show the students tapes of themselves reading fluently. After each intervention phase, the students graphed the progress of their words correct per minute (WCPM) and number of errors. The results did not show a significant increase in WCPM or a significant decrease in the number of errors made while reading with the exception of participant 4. Participant 4 experienced a significant decrease in the number of errors she made while reading. However, pre- to post-CBA changes were noted for 3 participants. Participants showed some gain in reading skills as measured by their post-CBA probes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - For researchers seeking to improve education, a common goal is to identify teaching practices that have causal benefits in classroom settings. To test whether an instructional practice exerts a causal influence on an outcome measure, the most straightforward and compelling method is to conduct an experiment. While experimentation is common in laboratory studies of learning, experimentation is increasingly rare in classroom settings, and to date, researchers have argued it is prohibitively expensive and difficult to conduct experiments on education in situ. To address this challenge, we present Terracotta (Tool for Education Research with RAndomized COnTrolled TriAls), an open-source web application that integrates with a learning management system to provide a comprehensive experimental research platform within an online class site. Terracotta automates randomization, informed consent, experimental manipulation of different versions of learning activities, and export of de-identified research data. Here we describe these features, and the results of a live classroom demonstration study using Terracotta, a preregistered replication of McDaniel et al. ("Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition," 1(1), 18-26, 2012). Using Terracotta, we experimentally manipulated online review assignments so that consenting students alternated, on a weekly basis, between taking multiple-choice quizzes (retrieval practice) and reading answers to these quizzes (restudy). Students' performance on subsequent exams was significantly improved for items that had been in retrieval practice review assignments. This successful replication demonstrates that Terracotta can be used to experimentally manipulate consequential aspects of students' experiences in education settings.

AB  - We report on a randomized controlled trial of an intervention that leverages the availability of laptops for all public-school students in the state of Maine. The intervention, called "ASSISTments," provides feedback to students as they solve mathematics homework problems and automatically prepares reports for teachers about student performance on daily assignments. Teachers received training and coaching on formative assessment. Data was collected from 43 schools, 87 teachers, and 2769 7th grade students. Planned analyses describe use of the intervention, analyze the impact of the intervention on an end-of-year standardized assessment, and explore variables that may moderate or mediate impacts. Findings indicate that students in the schools assigned to use ASSISTments learned more and the impact was greater for students with lower prior mathematics achievement. Although evidence shows that teachers used the intervention to target instruction to students' needs, the mediating role of this practice was unclear. We also examined the generalizability of the findings and found generalizability to be limited due to the setting in Maine. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.

AB  - Assessment should not only be carried out when the learning ends (or assessment of learning) but also during the learning process through assessment for learning and assessment as learning approaches. These approaches can be achieved by integrating formative assessment during the learning process. Formative assessments provide information about students' strengths and weaknesses in learning by giving feedback. Giving immediate feedback is very necessary to close the gap in students' concepts. Giving a test with immediate feedback can increase students' learning interests and provide reinforcement and improvement in students' understanding of concepts. This research aimed to find out the increased junior high school students' concepts understanding in science learning which is integrated with web-assisted formative assessment on materials of vibrations, waves, and sounds. This research was conducted in VIII-C Class SMPN 1 Malang, the academic year of 2018-2019. The research design used was a mixed method with an embedded experimental mixed method. Quantitative data were in the form of pretest and posttest scores. Qualitative data were the results of observations during the learning process, answers to worksheets, and the results of interviews with students. On the other hand, quantitative data analysis includes the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, paired t-test, N-gain, and d-effect size. Qualitative data analysis is data reduction. From the d-effect size test result, the score obtained was 2.25 (high category), and N-gain indicated a score of 0.63 (above the medium category). The study indicated that students' understanding of concepts has improved through science learning integrated with web-assisted formative assessment.

AB  - Progress monitoring assessment is one of the four essential components of Response to Intervention (RTI), as defined by the National Center on Response to Intervention (NCRTI). Progress data allow teachers to evaluate the academic performance of students over time, quantify rates of improvement or responsiveness to instruction, and evaluate instructional effectiveness. For the students who are least responsive to instruction, progress monitoring may also be used to formulate effective individualized programs (NCRTI, 2010). This brief focuses on progress monitoring using individual student, curriculum-based measurement (CBM) scores, and is based on recommendations from the "RTI Implementer Series Progress Monitoring--Training Manual" (NCRTI, 2012). The brief discusses the value of using graphs as part of the progress monitoring process and presents methods for setting appropriate progress monitoring goals. In addition, it focuses on a common error in graphing, the omission of a goal and a goal line, and explains why it is important to include these elements for productive, data-based decision making. A quick look at the importance of monitoring a student's error rate concludes this brief.

AB  - Progress monitoring, one of the essential components of Response to Intervention (RTI), is characterized by repeated measurement of academic performance that is conducted at least monthly. The process may be used to assess students' academic performance over time, to quantify student rates of improvement or responsiveness to instruction, and to evaluate instructional effectiveness. For students with disabilities, progress monitoring may also be used to formulate effective individualized programs (National Center on Response to Intervention [NCRTI], 2010). Successful implementation of progress monitoring is the result of careful planning and thoughtful practice. Omitting key components of the progress monitoring process can lead to wasted time and invalid results. This brief focuses on five common omissions in progress monitoring practices and planning and explains how these activities are integral to the process of meaningful data-based decision making.

AB  - School authorities, universities, and employers often schedule multiple tests on the same day or week, causing overlapping exam preparation and a dense testing schedule. This multitask learning can be intense, under pressure, and challenge the student's mental and physical perseverance. As a result, it can compromise performance relative to a more 'relaxed' schedule. This paper examines the consequences of multitasking for test scores and cheating in exams and its implications for the ability and gender cognitive gap. The empirical context is high-stakes exit exams in Israel, done at the end of high school. I leverage the empirical setting on two natural experiments to estimate the causal effect of this multitasking learning. The first exploits random variation in the number of weekly tests--the second hinges on days with multiple exams versus days with a single exam. The results show several important regularities. First, the number of exams in a day or a week harms test performance. Second, these effects are evidenced for high and low-ability students, boys and girls. They are much more extensive for immigrants than natives. Third, the harm of such multitasking is larger in tests later in the schedule, daily or weekly. Fourth, these effects are larger in tests of STEM subjects. Fifth, dense exams schedule increase the likelihood of students behaving dishonestly in exams.

AB  - An examination of evidence-based practices for mathematics reveals that a solid grasp of key algebraic topics is essential for successful transition from concrete to abstract reasoning in mathematics. In addition, experts indicate a need to emphasize formative assessment to allow results to inform instruction. To address the dearth of technically adequate assessments designed to support data based decision making in algebra, this study examined (a) the validity of algebra and mixed computation curriculum-based measurement for predicting mid-year general math and algebra outcomes in 8th grade (b) growth rates for algebra and mixed computation CBM in the fall of 8th grade, (c) whether slope is a significant predictor of general math and algebra outcomes after controlling for initial skill, and (d) whether growth rates differ for pre-algebra and algebra students. Participants were 198 eighth grade pre-algebra ( n = 70) and algebra (n = 128) students from three middle schools in the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate moderate relationships between fall performance on mixed computation and algebra CBM and winter SAT-10 and algebra performance and significant growth across the fall. Growth was not found to predict general math and algebra outcomes after controlling for initial skill. Future studies should examine (a) growth rates over an extended period of time with a larger sample of classrooms, (b) instructional variables that may impact growth across classrooms, and (c) the impact on student performance when data gleaned from the mixed computation and algebra CBM are used to support data based decision making in middle school algebra and pre-algebra classrooms.

AB  - Although extensive research exists on the use of curriculum-based measures for progress monitoring, little is known about using computer adaptive tests (CATs) for progress-monitoring purposes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the frequency of data collection on individual and group growth estimates using a CAT. Data were available for 278 fourth- and fifth-grade students. Growth estimates were obtained when five, three, and two data collections were available across 18 weeks. Data were analyzed by grade to evaluate any observed differences in growth. Further, root mean square error values were obtained to evaluate differences in individual student growth estimates across data collection schedules. Group-level estimates of growth did not differ across data collection schedules; however, growth estimates for individual students varied across the different schedules of data collection. Implications for using CATs to monitor student progress at the individual or group level are discussed.

AB  - Formative assessment has long been used to gauge students' understanding of course material prior to taking an exam. With the advent of more advanced technology, only recently have instructors been able to combine formative assessment with a student response system to allow students to respond to questions in real time during class. Previous studies show mixed findings on the relationship between the use of student response systems and student learning. For example, some studies show that those students who used a student response system performed better on exams or in the course when compared to those who did not, while others found no significant difference. In addition, the influence of testing students formatively multiple times before a summative assessment has been of little focus. A quasi-experimental design was used in this study to test students on 112 concepts in introductory statistics at three time points: during class using a student response system, during an online quiz about one week later, and on an exam at the end of the unit. Each concept was associated with one of four course units and was assigned a level of cognitive demand. The primary goal of the study was to determine if the sequences of correct and incorrect responses that students provided on two formative assessments influenced their ability to answer a corresponding summative assessment question correctly using a logistic regression model and Monte Carlo simulation. Also, a series of loglinear models was used to determine if the sequence of responses, unit of the course, and level of cognitive demand were independent. The results of this study indicate that students who answered both formative assessments correctly performed the best on the exam, followed by those who answered only the quiz question correctly. However, students who answered only the student response system question correctly fared no better on the exam than those who missed both formative assessments. Students who completed more sequences were more likely to overachieve their predicted exam results. Moreover, the results showed that students' sequences of responses, the course unit, and the level of cognitive demand were not independent. Students tended to overachieve on less cognitively demanding sequences requiring descriptive statistics and on strategic thinking exam questions requiring inference, but underachieved in the probability unit and on more challenging descriptive statistics questions. This study provided insight on the influence of that repeated practice on exam performance, suggesting that working independently after learning a concept is more beneficial to student learning than using a student response system in class. This study also demonstrated how statistics education can effectively use formative assessment in the classroom and test higher-order thinking using multiple-choice questions. University instructors may find the results useful in reevaluating the use of active learning in their classroom.

AB  - This study identified the relationships among English Language Arts teacher teams, their collaboration in creating formative assessment, and its impact on the academic achievement of middle school students. The setting of this study was two urban private Nursery through Grade 8 elementary schools in 1 New York City district. The design for this study was a mixed-method research design, which gathered both quantitative as well as qualitative data to answer the research questions. The research included observations, interviews, small samples of lesson plans, and standard assessment tools (t-test). The observations took place in 2 different 6th grade English Language Arts classrooms, as well as observations of 1 school's teacher team meeting. The data gathered, in addition to the observations, were pre- and post-English Language Arts test from both classes. The results did not support the theory that when teachers work collaboratively in teacher teams, that there is a positive impact on their students' academic performance.

AB  - This thesis examines the effects of frequent testing (through the use of Precision Teaching and its variants) on reading skills and motivation to read for children aged 7 to 9 years old.The literature review explores the effectiveness of Precision Teaching for improving reading skills in children with reading difficulties within the school setting. 12 studies were identified and assessed using Gough's (2007) weight of evidence framework. Gersten et al.'s (2005) coding protocol was used for quasi-experimental designs and Horner et al.'s (2005) coding protocol for single-case designs. The review concludes that Precision Teaching is effective for improving reading difficulties and is ecologically valid. Effect sizes were calculated for 6 papers which generated a large effect ranging from d = 1.56 to 4.02. Implications and recommendations for future practice are highlighted.The empirical paper explores whether frequent testing (through the use of a 10-week online Precision Teaching programme) would lead to an improvement in children's reading skills and therefore improve their motivation to read. It also explores whether a higher frequency of testing will lead to a bigger improvement in motivation to read compared to a lower frequency of testing. A quasi-experimental design was used. 36 participants aged 7 to 9 years old were recruited from 8 mainstream schools. An ANOVA and t-tests were used to analyse the data. Results revealed that frequent testing had significantly improved children's reading skills. Improvement in reading skills did not lead to any significant increase in reading motivation. A higher frequency of testing also did not lead to improvements in reading motivation. Implications and recommendations for future practice are highlighted.Chapter 4 discusses how this thesis contributes to evidence-based practice, its impact on relevant stakeholders and the dissemination of results to various audiences.

AB  - Emergent reading levels are those levels a pupil can sustain under direct guidance or with mediation and support by the teacher. A major implication of the emergent reading level construct is that strategies for reading placement would need to be revised. A study was conducted to ascertain whether the emergent reading level concept is valid and useful in the reading placement of low socioeconomic status (SES), low achieving elementary school students. Nineteen fourth grade students, enrolled in Chapter 1 classrooms, with a reading grade equivalent of 2.7 to 5.00 participated. As a pretest measure, students read a fable at the fifth grade level and answered 20 multiple choice questions. Prior to the reading, the experimenter read the requisite vocabulary, using each word in a sentence. The experimenter then read several poems as an interference measure. A week later, students were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The procedure was repeated for the control group. The experimental group received background knowledge on fables and discussed the vocabulary in context. The students then read a fable passage and answered questions. The results showed a significant difference between the groups in the posttest measure, favoring an analytical application concept of emergent reading level with low achieving students. (HTH)

AB  - For many educators and their students, homework is part of standard school practice. Homework as an exercise is not nearly as important as its intended purpose. The common intent for assigning homework is for students to practice recently obtained skills and knowledge as well as expanding individual understanding. Unfortunately, changes in household dynamics, inconsistent practice, and less consistent completion all make homework's impact uneven. The purpose of this research is two-fold. First, the examination of homework practice compared to student achievement in seventh and eighth grade science. Second, the research will measure the impact of the implementation of differentiated independent work in middle school science class as a homework alternative. The dissertation conducts a study to demonstrate that structuring class time to include independent work in lieu of homework has a greater impact on learning. Employing practices, such as assigning homework, based on tradition is not the most effective method for assessing and addressing individual progress. Instructional design and classroom structure must be created within the culture of a school so that each student achieves success. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research on the testing effect has provided evidence that testing enhances long-term memory (Agarwal, Karpicke, Kang, McDermott, & Roediger, 2008; McDaniel, Roediger & McDermott, 2007; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Whereas much of this research has been conducted using prose passages, there are some who have studied the effectiveness of testing in more practical, classroom settings (Jensen, Kromann, & Ringsted, 2009; McDaniel et al., 2007). However, research has not yet provided evidence of the benefits of testing in long-term memory retrieval in a math domain. Two studies were conducted to assess whether the testing effect occurred in learning math facts. Experiment 1 assessed the effectiveness of testing in math fact learning, and examined math anxiety as a covariate. Experiment 2 investigated the effectiveness of two levels of retrieval practice, production and verification, in producing a testing effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 examined participants' ability to make accurate judgments of learning (JOLs).

AB  - This thesis discusses the effects of frequent, secure automated testing on student performance in CS 421, a class titled Programming Languages and Compilers at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, and examines in-depth the tools utilized to enable such testing. In particular, it looks into the use of PrairieLearn and the Computer-based Testing Center as a testing platform and service to determine the ramifications of automated testing. It was found that students experienced up to a 12 percent increase in their final grade in Fall 2015 over students in Fall 2014. Additionally, it was shown that the use of custom-built tools on PrairieLearn in enabling testing of Programming Languages-related concepts did not adversely affect and in some cases, statistically significantly increased student grades.

AB  - In 2014, South Bend's Our Lady of Hungary Catholic School welcomed its third principal in four years: Kevin Goralczyk, an Indiana native and seasoned educator. Together with the parish's pastor, Reverend Kevin Bauman, Principal Goralczyk began exploring how OLH could raise its pre-K-8 student achievement and better support teachers and staff serving a fast-changing school population. Both leaders looked for solutions aligned with their school's "Excellence for Everyone" mantra, which led them to partner with Northwest Evaluation Association™ (NWEA™). The school saw significant changes during their first year using Measures of Academic Progress® (MAP®) interim assessments, Children's Progress Academic Assessment™ (CPAA™) early learning skills assessment, and NWEA professional development focused on classroom formative assessment strategies. Student growth accelerated, teachers' skills strengthened, and students become more engaged with their personal learning journeys.

AB  - Given previous findings on test enhanced learning, the present study examined the implementation of this practice in terms of quizzing, during the progress of a course. After completing the university course, 88 Swedish teacher students were asked to answer an adapted Retrieval Practice and Test Anxiety Survey. The results showed that students perceived quizzing to improve learning, and reduce test anxiety. Nonetheless, based on students' misconceptions regarding why quizzing actually enhances learning, it is suggested that implications of test enhanced learning was not fully conveyed. It is for educational purpose imperative to not forget this application.

AB  - In the current era of high stakes testing, educators use curriculum-based measures (CBMs) and large-scale benchmark assessments to inform instruction and monitor student performance. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, The No Child Left Behind Act, and Race to the Top all require annual testing in grades 3 through 8 in mathematics and reading. Therefore, educators need appropriate assessments to make valid inferences about instruction and students' current level of performance as well as risk. Consequently, construct validity is essential for both CBMs and large-scale tests to ensure they appropriately identify students' current level of performance in reading and math, particularly in making inferences about proficiency (Adequate Yearly Progress). This study of third grade students explored the construct validity of a state math test by correlating it with both math and reading CBMs and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the CBM in predicting performance on the state test. Results indicated a positive correlation and predictive relation between both CBM math and reading with the Oregon statewide benchmark assessment in mathematics at third grade. Regression analysis showed the strength of the predictive relation of CBM in the identification of students' current level of performance increased with the addition of CBM reading to the CBM math. A receiver operator characteristics analysis indicated that CBM math and CBM reading (passage reading fluency and vocabulary) consistently predicted students who were on target to meet grade-level benchmarks on the statewide assessment. The study adds to the construct validity research on math and reading CBMs. The results may inform assessment development and accommodations needed to assess math content without the reading construct interfering with the interpretation of the results. In addition, it may be useful for educators seeking to identify students who are "at risk" for making grade level progress in mathematics.

AB  - The study investigates interaction effects of formative testing and attitudinal types as they affect students' achievement in mathematics. A total of 120 students are drawn from the three geopolitical zones of Delta State and participated in the experiment. Three-of-the-four formative test instruments were used namely: self-report rating scale; quadratic achievement test, graphical solution of Quadratic equation achievement test, and graphical solution of quadratic equation ability instrument to aid data collection for the study. Data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and two-way analysis of variance. Results shows that formative test (with reference to close book formative testing) contributed significantly to students' achievement in mathematics. Close book, followed by open book formative testing type are found to significantly contribute to students' achievement. Implications of the findings will help to boost the quality of teaching and learning of science (with respect to mathematics) education in Nigeria such as yield a useful direction towards the development of mathematics education in relation to learners' achievement as well as give a picture of the importance of formative testing to performance achievement mathematics.

AB  - The ineffectiveness of the strategies traditionally employed by science teachers has been attested to by several researchers. Thus, research in science education has continued to seek for more effective ways of teaching science in general and biology in particular in order to ensure meaningful learning. Therefore, this study examined Senior Secondary School Students' Cognitive Achievement in Selected Biology Concepts using Mercedes Model with Embedded Assessment Strategies. The study adopted pretest-post-test control group, quasi experimental design. From the six education districts (EDs) in Lagos State, two were purposively selected. The two EDs were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Three senior secondary schools were randomly selected from each ED. Altogether, a total of six schools in the two selected EDs were involved in the study. Two intact classes (one science and another non-science) were randomly selected from each of the six schools making a total of twelve classes. Five instruments were used. These included: Mercedes Model with Embedded Assessment Strategy in Diffusion (MEASID), Mercedes Model with Embedded Assessment Strategy in Osmosis (MEASIO). Conventional Lesson Plan on Diffusion (COLPOD), Conventional Lesson Plan on Osmosis (COLPO) and Test on Students' Learning Outcomes in Osmosis and Diffusion (TESLOOD). Seven hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. Data collected were analysed using frequency counts, means, deviation, analysis of covariance, multiple classification analysis. There was significant effect of treatment on students' cognitive achievement on selected biology concepts. Also, subject specialization has a significant effect on the dependent measures. Further, the effect of gender on students' knowledge of the selected biology concept is significant in favour of males. From the findings of this study the Mercedes Model with Embedded Assessment Strategies was effective and noticeably improved students' cognitive achievement. Furthermore, the biology students in the science class performed better than their counterparts in the non-science class. This study also showed that the Mercedes Model with Embedded Strategy was of equal benefit to both male and female students. It was recommended that biology teachers should adopt Mercedes Model with Embedded Assessment Strategy in the teaching of secondary school students.

AB  - Poor early literacy skills can impact a child significantly, limiting school achievement and success throughout the life span. Difficulties are also associated with numerous social problems. Students exhibiting prereading skill deficits often fall even further behind their classmates in later elementary years (Cusumanzo, 2007; Deno, 1989; Goffreda, Diperna, & Pedersen, 2009; Hoffman, Jenkins, & Dunlap, 2009). The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 mandated statewide accountability for achieving adequate yearly progress in reading (No Child Left Behind Act; 2001). As a result, schools across the country are using progress monitoring tools and more frequently measuring students' progress in reading to ensure they are on target for achieving yearly reading goals. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Kaminski & Good, 1996) is one popular assessment tool, used to identify and frequently monitor students having difficulties with skills determined to be important for acquiring reading. With the use of progress monitoring tools, such as DIBELS, schools should be able to identify the needs of all children and customize instruction to individual students, particularly those determined to be struggling with reading. This could lead to improved reading skills and, ultimately, higher statewide achievement test scores. This study examined the relationship between school districts in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, that do or do not use DIBELS and their results on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA), a standardized statewide assessment of reading and mathematics.

AB  - Information technology is an integral part of current education, even in noncomputer disciplines. As the role of Information technology-based education tools is recognized as significant in the education of millennial learners, there is a development of different types of tools and techniques in education. Usage of such tools in content delivery and assessment has been found to improve student engagement and active learning. When looking for unique tools to practice and assess computer programming and algorithmic courses, online coding events launched by popular forums have been identified as a tool for practice and assessment. These forums have been introducing new computing problems specified in a professional language, so that students get trained in programming these complex problems rather than the conventional problems. This article explores the possibility and success measure of integrating online coding events as a part of formative assessment. A study has been performed with two consecutive offerings of a course. The results obtained from the various forms of assessment are analyzed and presented in terms of correlation with summative and formative assessment scores and improved student performance. The results of the experimental study are found encouraging, thereby appreciating the usage of online coding platforms for introductory programming and algorithmic courses.

AB  - Despite the fact that OECD education analysts recommend using formative assessment, summative assessment remains preferred in Slovak education. Formative assessment is rarely used because Slovak teachers require further training provided through projects such as Teachers and IT Akadémia. Formative assessment is an efficient tool improving the quality of the learning process, which provides targeted feedback on the quality of the education process as well. This paper presents the result of a study focused on the impact of formative assessment tools implemented in the education process, in teaching Chemistry at primary schools, on the development of conceptual understanding in students on selected levels of Bloom's taxonomy (remembering, understanding, application, analysis). The research involved Chemistry teachers from selected primary schools located in the Košice Region (N=3) and 7th grade students from parallel classes at primary schools (N=126). Quasi-experiment was used as the main research method. Research instruments in the control and experimental groups included two standardised cognitive tests (pre-test and post-test). Pre-test and post-test reliability showed a = 0.686 and a = 0.730 respectively, which is above the minimum value. The results of the research indicated a statistically significant effect of formative assessment on the development of students' conceptual understanding (p<0.05) not only in lower-order cognitive processes (remembering, understanding), but also in higher-order cognitive processes (application and analysis).

AB  - While the learning benefits of retrieval activities have been clearly demonstrated in laboratory settings, evidence on their usefulness in naturalistic school settings is still scant. The goal of the present studies was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of retrieval-based learning in children (fourth and sixth grades) when school teachers themselves design and implement retrieval activities relating to genuine curriculum contents. Three studies were conducted in a public elementary school with fourth and sixth graders and their teachers. Two of the studies involved mathematics and one dealt with social sciences. Teachers used learning activities that required students to recall part of previously taught concepts, while different concepts in the same unit were worked through with those learning activities that were normally used by each teacher. Two out of three studies revealed that, relative to business-as-usual learning activities, performing retrieval activities during classes led to better performance in the assessments at the end of the lessons. Overall, our finding provides preliminary evidence that retrieval activities can enhance learning in elementary school children when they are devised by teachers in the exercise of their professional duties. These results have important practical implications and suggest that, if teachers are aware of the value of retrieval activities in fostering meaningful learning, these activities could be successfully embedded in their daily duties even when considering the constraints imposed by school reality.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of formative assessment practices on students' academic achievement, attitudes toward lessons, and self-regulation skills in the fifth-grade social studies class. Mixed method research was used to conduct the study. The research group consisted of 45 students in the fifth grade of a secondary school in Erzurum in the academic year 2014-2015, and a teacher who performed the practices. Experimental procedures were carried out for 28 weeks. Social studies performance tests, attitude inventories for social studies classes, self-regulatory learning skills scales, semi-structured interview forms, and observation forms were all used as data collection instruments. As a result of the research, it was determined that the experimental group in which the formative assessment practices were performed had a significantly higher academic achievement levels and better attitudes toward the class than the students did in the control group. With regard to the students' self-regulation skills, although the formative assessment had a positive effect, no significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups. According to the researcher's observations and the interviews conducted with the teacher and students, it was determined that the general view on the application of formative assessment was notably positive.

AB  - The mainstream research on scoring rubrics has emphasized the summative aspect of assessment. In recent years, the use of rubrics for formative purposes has gained more attention. This research has, however, not been conclusive. The aim of this study is therefore to review the research on formative use of rubrics, in order to investigate if, and how, rubrics have an impact on student learning. In total, 21 studies about rubrics were analyzed through content analysis. Sample, subject/task, design, procedure, and findings, were compared among the different studies in relation to effects on student performance and selfregulation. Findings indicate that rubrics may have the potential to influence students learning positively, but also that there are several different ways for the use of rubrics to mediate improved performance and self-regulation. There are a number of factors identified that may moderate the effects of using rubrics formatively, as well as factors that need further investigation. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - This paper advocates the use of the Dynamic Approach (DA) to promote Student Self-Assessment (SSA) for formative purposes. DA is based on the assumption that professional development should be differentiated to meet teachers' needs, while engaging them into guided critical reflection. A sample of 45 teachers was randomly allocated into two groups: one experimental group which received an INSET course based on the DA and one control group. Assessment skills and student outcomes (cognitive and metacognitive) were measured at the beginning and the end of the intervention. Teachers employing the DA improved their skills but no change in the assessment skills of the control group was observed. DA had an impact on student achievement in mathematics. Implications are drawn.

AB  - Objective: To determine if the frequency of self-testing of course material prior to actual examination improves examination scores, regardless of the actual scores on the self-testing. Methods: Practice quizzes were randomly generated from a total of 1342 multiple-choice questions in pathophysiology and made available online for student self-testing. Intercorrelations, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc tests, and 2-group comparisons following rank ordering, were conducted. Results: During each of 4 testing blocks, more than 85% of students took advantage of the self-testing process for a total of 7042 attempts. A consistent significant correlation (p⩽0.05) existed between the number of practice quiz attempts and the subsequent examination scores. No difference in the number of quiz attempts was demonstrated compared to the first testing block. Exam scores for the first and second testing blocks were both higher than those for third and fourth blocks. Conclusion: Although self-testing strategies increase retrieval and retention, they are uncommon in pharmacy education. The results suggested that the number of self-testing attempts alone improved subsequent examination scores, regardless of the score for self-tests.

AB  - Although corrective feedback (CF) has been studied, more studies still need to be conducted on this variable to check its effects on language learning. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of teachers' written and verbal CF during the formative assessment (FA) on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' academic anxiety (AA), academic performance (AP), and attitude toward learning (ATL) in Ahvaz, Iran. Using the convenience sampling method, 76 students were chosen and divided into the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). The EG received CF during FA, but CG was taught traditionally. After analyzing the data through descriptive and inferential statistics, the results indicated that the teachers' written and verbal CF during FA positively affected the experimental language learners' AP. In addition, the results showed that teachers' CF significantly diminished the EG's level of anxiety. Regarding the learners' ATL English, the results showed that there was a significant change in the pre-test and post-test due to the feedback received from the teacher, which means that learners' ATL enhanced remarkably. Considering the results of this study, a number of conclusions are drawn, and several implications are put forward.

AB  - Inconsistent math assessment practices do not accurately represent and communicate student mathematics achievement. Because of inconsistencies in assessment practices, local middle school mathematics teachers in an urban school district in the northwestern United States piloted the use of multiple formative assessments. The purpose of this study was to compare mathematics achievement, growth, and course percentage grades for students who have multiple formative assessment attempts compared to students who are not provided multiple assessment attempts. Theoretical foundations originated from Black and Wiliam, supporting the use of formative assessment for a positive impact on student learning. A quantitative, ex post facto quasi-experimental design was used. The research question focused on the statistical differences in course percentage grade, state standardized testing score, and growth score on state standardized math tests between groups of students who were allowed multiple formative assessment options and those who were not. Data were analyzed using an independent samples t test and a one-way MANOVA, which showed a statistically significant difference for student course percentage grade. Findings were used to produce a 3-day professional development program supporting teachers' use of formative assessment in mathematics classes. The findings will inform educational stakeholders' decisions regarding the use of multiple assessment attempts and differences between this specific formative assessment strategy and student mathematics assessment performance to promote positive social change. Positive social changes may include increased awareness of how multiple assessments may affect student growth, course percentage grades, and state testing scores.

AB  - A review of the literature pertaining to the effect and influence that interim assessments have on student achievement lacks quantitative data to determine the efficiency of their use in the classroom as a school reform tool. This study examined the strength and the direction of the relationships between interim pre and posttest assessments in language arts and mathematics in Grade 8 and student achievement on the New Jersey Grade 8 state standardized tests in those subjects. Analyses were conducted using simultaneous multiple regression models. All student data explored in this study pertained to 670 students in Grade 8 enrolled in four middle schools located in a suburban/urban central New Jersey community during the 2009-2010 academic school year. The results of the study revealed each school produced a combination of site specific results and the interim pretests accounted for the same or almost the same amount of variance in state test scores as the interim posttests.

AB  - New Hampshire's Performance Assessment of Competency Education (PACE) innovative assessment system uses student scores from classroom performance assessments as well as other classroom tests for school accountability purposes. One concern is that not having annual state testing may incentivize schools and teachers away from teaching the breadth of the state content standards. This study examined the effects of PACE on Grade 8 test scores after 5 years of implementation using propensity score matching followed by hierarchical linear modeling. The results suggest that PACE students perform about the same, on average, in mathematics and ELA as non-PACE students on the state assessment. There was no evidence of differential effects for students who had an individualized education program or were granted FRL. Findings for this limited sample suggest schools and teachers did not sacrifice the breadth of students' opportunity to learn the state content standards while piloting a state performance assessment reform.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of using online formative assessments on students' learning achievements. Using a quasi-experimental study design with one control group (no formative assessments available), and two experimental groups receiving feedback in available online formative assessments (knowledge of the correct response--KCR, or elaborated feedback--EF), it was investigated how feedback type in combination with learning content complexity will affect students' learning achievements when used in-vivo, in a digital signal processing university course. Data generated by the two experimental groups was additionally used to investigate differences in using online formative assessments based on the feedback type. Study findings suggest online formative assessments are a very efficient educational intervention for this domain. The acquired data suggests that students quickly recognized the value of the formative assessments and that more than 90% of students have used them extensively. Statistically significant improvements in learning achievements were observed in the KCR group compared to the control group (p < 0.01, Cohen's d between 0.691 and 1.080, depending on the learning content complexity), and KCR group compared to the EF group (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.877, in the case of most complex of the three learning contents used). No statistically significant differences were found in formative assessment usage between the two experimental groups, aside from the difference in the time between consecutive formative assessment attempts, indicating students did make use of the available feedback. Reported results are significant for demonstrating the potential of online formative assessments in achieving the desired learning outcomes in higher education, as well as for gaining insights into students' habits of using them.

AB  - The POWERSOURCE[c] intervention is intended as a generalizable and powerful formative assessment strategy that can be integrated with any mathematics curriculum. POWERSOURCE[c] includes both a system of learning-based assessments and an infrastructure to support teachers' use of those assessments to improve student learning. The core undertaking of our work during the 2008-09 school year was to continue with an extended, random assignment implementation study of the POWERSOURCE[c] program. Results from our analyses indicated that a short amount of targeted intervention on key mathematical principles had a positive impact on student performance on transfer measures of related content. The POWERSOURCE[c] intervention had more impact on the relatively higher-performing students than the lower-performing students; that is, those students with higher initial pretest scores tended to benefit more from the treatment when compared to students with lower pretest scores.

AB  - The authors describe results from a study of a middle school mathematics formative assessment strategy. They employed a randomized, controlled design to address the following question: Does using our strategy improve student performance on assessments of key mathematical ideas relative to a comparison group? Eighty-five teachers and 4,091 students were included. Students took a pretest and a transfer measure at the end of the year. Treatment students completed formative assessments. Treatment teachers had exposure to professional development and instructional resources. Results indicated students with higher pretest scores benefited more from the treatment compared to students with lower pretest scores. In addition treatment students significantly outperformed control students on distributive property items. This effect was larger as pretest scores increased. Results, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

AB  - This paper describes results from field testing of middle-school math formative assessments alongside professional development and instructional resources. We employed a randomised, controlled design to address the question: Does using our formative assessment strategies improve student performance on assessments of key mathematical ideas relative to a comparison group? This study also provided data on the instructional sensitivity of the assessments, which is part of the validation needed for formative assessments. Teachers were recruited from two districts and seven middle schools. Nineteen treatment and 17 comparison group teachers and their students were included in study analyses. Scores on extended response and short-answer questions indicated that students in the treatment group performed better than students in the comparison group who received the formative assessments alone. These findings demonstrate both the feasibility and value of including performance task-types in a brief assessment context. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies provide a new perspective for designing innovative outdoor learning experiences. The purpose of this study is to propose a formative assessment design for integrating PDAs into ecology observations. Three learning activities were conducted in this study. An action research approach was applied to continually revise the worksheet designs. Twenty-seven 5th and 6th graders' observation skills using PDAs, and their extended inquiry performance using e-diaries were assessed. An e-library, and online scoring and feedback systems were developed accordingly. The results suggest that the embedded formative assessment designs were effective for guiding and supporting the students' learning progress. The activity worksheets successfully helped the students focus their outdoor learning attention on the target tasks. The e-library provided reliable resources to clarify their observed descriptions, while the automatic scoring and feedback systems were especially helpful in sustaining the students' persistent effort. Most students demonstrated substantial improvements in their observation skills, and extended their inquiry abilities. The well designed online formative assessment embedded in the activity worksheet is very promising for PDA integrated learning.

AB  - Formative assessment is considered to be a promising teaching practice for promoting teaching and learning processes. The implementation of teaching practices into instruction involves intervening with a learning environment that is characterised by certain features of instructional quality. Our study aims to contribute to the understanding of formative assessment by analysing the interplay between a formative assessment intervention and aspects of general instructional quality. In a quasi-experimental study design, 15 teachers participated in a control group (n = 361 students) and 20 teachers in the intervention classes (n = 498 students) implemented a curriculum-embedded formative assessment tool in their ninth-grade mathematics classes. No effects were found for the intervention on the assessed aspects of general instructional quality (process-oriented instruction, teacher-student relationship, effective use of instructional time). However, multilevel regression analyses revealed an interaction effect between the intervention and process-orientation and the effective use of instruction time. Our findings suggest that implementing formative assessment tools do not seem to suffice regarding changes in general instructional quality, but that an intervention with detailed material and guidelines can counterbalance effects of instructional quality, fostering students' achievement in classes with lower degrees of process orientation and a less effective use of instructional time.

AB  - Of many instructional strategies used to improve teaching and learning in science, formative assessment is potentially one of the most effective. A central feature is timely feedback during learning, giving students the opportunity to benefit and improve while also enabling teachers to adjust instruction to learner needs. By contrast, conventional assessment tends to be mostly summative, assigning point scores, grading and ranking students, and providing extrinsic motivation. For maximum effectiveness in enhancing learning, formative assessment should be designed into instruction from the start rather than being an add-on. This project comprised development, teaching, and research aspects. Two physics topic modules, dynamics and kinematics, were structured into sets of learning units subdivided into concept aspects. Assessments were embedded appropriately in these. Each topic module was taught in two modes; in one version, formative assessment and feedback strategies were integrated into instruction, while the other version used conventional summative assessment with graded quizzes and homework. A controlled study was conducted to compare the effects of the two systems on student performance and attitude. The topic modules were implemented in two class sections of an introductory physics course, in formative and summative assessment modes. A crossover research design involved two classes, two topics, and two modes, so that all students in the two classes experienced each mode for one or the other topic, with the same instructor. Student learning was measured using pre- and posttests and calculating normalized gains. For dynamics, a conceptual unit, learning gains were substantially higher for the formative than the summative system, while for kinematics, a more formula-based unit, the difference was less marked. Student attitudes toward various aspects of two systems, and the reasons for their preferences, were ascertained using written surveys. Students much preferred the formative system, giving reasons such as feedback, chance to improve and less pressure, but they also felt the need for summative final grades. An unexpected additional result was that students who experienced the formative or summative modes last in the course gave very different formal evaluations of course and instructor. Overall, students performed significantly better in the formative system, and most students preferred a combination of formative assessment during learning and summative at the end.

AB  - Spelling has been identified as a key transcription skill that emerges during the elementary years as students learn how to write and subsequently develop fluency with writing (McCutchen, 1996), making the assessment of spelling a critical component of evaluation systems within schools. This includes the use of curriculum-based measures of writing (CBM-W). This study examined the extent to which word dictation CBM-W administered during the Fall, Winter, and Spring of an academic year maintained technical adequacy across 1-minute time intervals in grades 1-3. Results revealed moderate predictive and concurrent validity estimates with the Spelling subtest of the Weschler Individual Achievement Test--III. Statistically significant differences existed between and within grade levels across each minute of administration and across Fall, Winter, and Spring time points for all scoring procedures.

AB  - Aim To evaluate daily-written 10-question quizzes in a medical anatomy course as a way to integrate assessment into the course and to evaluate their effect on the course success. Methods Students answering correctly 8/10 or more questions were awarded 0.5 points per quiz. There were 34 quizzes with a maximum point score 17. Measurable outcomes of academic progress in anatomy course (pass rates on 4 examination terms, total pass rate, and average marks) were calculated, and 2007/08 academic year was compared with the previous academic year in which daily written quizzes were not a part of the course. The relationship between cumulative points on daily quizzes and 3 components of the final examination (written, practical, and oral) for 2007/08 academic year was assessed by non-parametric correlation testing. Results Individual scores on quizzes ranged from 1.5 to 13.5 points. There was a positive correlation between scores on quizzes and grades on 3 components of the final examination: written (Spearman rho = 0.784, P < 0.001, n = 79), practical (Spearman rho = 0.342, P < 0.002, n = 79), and oral (Spearman rho = 0.683, P < 0.001, n = 79) part. Compared with students in the previous academic year, students attending the course with daily quizzes significantly improved their academic achievement, expressed as the pass rate at the first examination term (39% vs 62%, respectively, chi(2) test, P = 0.006,) and the average course grade (2.71 +/- 1.08 vs 3.38 +/- 1.26, respectively; t test, P < 0.001). Conclusion Despite their frequency and possible associated stress, daily quizzes were associated with better academic success in the anatomy course.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of practice mode (recall and recognition) in computer-based instruction on immediate and delayed achievement. A total of 153 seventh-grade science students participated in the study. Subjects were blocked by sex and randomly assigned to one of two practice modes (recall and recognition) in an instructional program and to both an immediate and delayed test or a delayed-only test condition. The criterion test was a 30-item posttest consisting of 15 recall items and 15 recognition items. After completing the instructional program, subjects were given the choice of topic, practice mode, and delivery medium for a second program. Achievement data were analyzed using MANOVA with the two types of test items as the dependent measures. MANOVA yielded no significant differences for achievement by practice mode or sex, except for a significant univariate effect indicating that recall practice yielded higher scores than recognition practice on recognition items for subjects who took the delayed test only. A strong time of testing effect revealed that subjects who took the immediate posttest scored significantly higher on the delayed test than subjects who took the delayed test only. This effect was significant at the.0001 level for both recall and recognition test items. The attitudinal data revealed that subjects' choice of topics to study varied significantly depending on whether the instruction for the topic was available on the computer. Subjects reported a strong preference for recognition over recall practice in addition to their preference for computer-delivered instruction.

AB  - This study examines the influence of a year-long mathematics professional development program on Kindergarten teachers' beliefs, content knowledge, instructional practices, and their students' achievement. The professional development program is grounded in the theoretical construct of learner-centered professional development and focuses on supporting teachers' integration of standards-based pedagogies aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics. Data analysis included examining 15 Kindergarten teachers' mathematics content knowledge, their beliefs about mathematics, their enactment of student-centered pedagogies, and student achievement on curriculum-based assessments. Findings indicated that teachers adopted more student-centered pedagogies and embraced more student-centered beliefs about mathematics teaching during their time in the project. Further, Kindergarten teachers also demonstrated gains in their mathematical content knowledge, and those content knowledge gains were linked to gains in student achievement.

AB  - This mixed design study investigated the predictive and instructional uses of two different types of interim mathematics assessments given in two different districts. One district administered the same summative type of assessment three times a year, while the other district administered a different interim assessment after six-week intervals of instruction. The quantitative component consisted of conducting several multiple regression analyses of students' mathematics results for grades four through ten on three different district benchmark assessments to identify if there were differences in the strengths of the relationships between student performance on the interim assessments and on their performance on the California Standards Tests for mathematics. For the qualitative component, analysis was conducted on data from teacher collaboration meeting observations and district and site interviews of stakeholders that shed light on those practices that best supported modification of instruction and improvement of teaching and learning. Quantitative results suggested that the overall student performance on both types of interim assessments used by District A and B respectively, had significant and strong positive correlations to student performance on the California State Tests California State Tests for grades 4-6 and results for grades 7-10 had significant and moderate, positive correlations to student performance on CSTs. Qualitative results identified conversations and behaviors that promoted or extended current data-informed decision-making theory. Five areas surfaced as contributing to teachers' capacity to make data actionable that relate to phases of the Data-Informed Decision Making Framework.

AB  - This limited meta-analysis on the Effective Schools Research topic of progress monitoring included 11 studies with 13 effect sizes. Twelve of the effect sizes focused on students at the elementary level and one focused on middle school, of the 11 studies, 6 used a randomized controlled study as their methodology. The studies included in this meta-analysis represented an assortment of dissertations, journal articles, and studies published for research organizations. All of the studies gave an effect size and sample size, were published after 2001, and had to include progress monitoring and a culminating assessment in order to be included in the study. Utilizing the technique of subgroup analysis, two moderator variables were considered in this study. The dichotomous variable of reading and mathematics showed a substantial difference in relationship to the impact of progress monitoring on student achievement. The subject area of mathematics g=.543 had a much larger effect-size than the subject area of reading g=.142. Unfortunately, when investigating the subgroup of poverty no relationship could be determined from these studies between the amount of poverty and the impact progress monitoring has on student achievement. Additionally, when meta-regression was utilized to examine the continuous variable of free and reduced-price lunch, although there was a negative slope, no correlation between the effects of poverty and progress monitoring could be determined within the studies in this meta-analysis. Additional research in the area of progress monitoring is still needed and is outlined within this study. As tools and software continue to be developed in the area of progress monitoring this study gives guidance to consider for educators and the impact that it has on student achievement.

AB  - The process of formative assessment on learning is very potential to improve students' concept. Nowadays, the coronavirus disease's deployment should be done at home, so it needs another effort to apply the formative assessment. In this case, we analyzed students' concept with the 5E learning cycle integrated formative e-assessment. The subjects of this study consisted of 31 students in one private high school in Malang, Indonesia. This research uses mixed-method with embedded experimental design. Multiple choice with reasons instruments used to measure students' concept before and after learning. The results showed development in students' concepts characterized by an average normalized-gain value of 0.56 and an effect size of 0.70. The integration of formative e-assessment is recommended to monitor students learning progress. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This review of literature on progress monitoring was designed to examine the full array of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) in mathematics for students from preschool to secondary schools. We organized the article around two primary concerns: the approach used to develop the measures (curriculum sampling or robust indicators) and the type of research necessary to establish the viability of the tasks. Our review addressed the technical adequacy of the measures as indicators of performance and progress, as well as teachers' use of the measures to improve achievement. The largest number of studies has been conducted at the elementary level, with less work in early mathematics or at the secondary level. In general, the measures have acceptable levels of reliability; the criterion validity of mathematics CBMs appears to be lower than that for reading CBMs. One important finding that emerged was the relatively low degree of consensus on the best approach to use in developing mathematics CBMs. We discuss probable reasons for this, along with implications for practice and research.

KV items included KV definitions and important usages in a multiple-choice cloze format. A KV and item database was constructed for all Grades 3, 4, and 5 science student outcomes by scrutinizing basal and supplemental instructional materials used in Texas schools. The resulting 620 KV terms and 1,800 test items were formatted for computer administration in computer-generated probes.This study examines results from equivalent KV-science probes, administered to students with special needs on a weekly basis, over 5 or 6 weeks. It also compares results from KV probes versus standard multiple-choice science items in simpler pre—post administration. Results encourage further development of KV-based probes for progress monitoring in the content area of science.

AB  - Reading comprehension is a major component in the 4th grade curriculum. Conducting more frequent reading assessments, diagnostically determining student's weaknesses and providing small group- direct instruction is a key component of the reading workshop. This research focused on the use of more frequent reading assessments followed by direct instruction based upon the students' mistakes. Three methods of data collection were used. A Developmental Reading Assessment, anecdotal records and both pre-test and post-test scores. The results indicated that the increased reading assessments and small group - direct instruction did improve the test scores of the 4 th grade students who participated in this study.

AB  - Formative assessments--assessments that measure what students do and do not know, so that teachers can modify their instruction accordingly--have been widely hailed as a potential vehicle for improving student achievement. Yet little solid research evidence exists about their effectiveness, especially in reform-rich school districts. This study examines the effects of the Formative Assessments of Student Thinking in Reading (FAST-R) initiative in the Boston Public Schools system (BPS), where the use of data to improve instruction is a general priority of the school district. The study looks at changes in reading scores over time at 21 BPS schools that operated FAST-R during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years and changes at a group of comparison schools serving demographically similar students during the same period. The MDRC evaluation includes process and impact analyses. The process analysis found that teachers at the FAST-R schools who took a survey administered as part of the study reported that the professional development they received from the BPE FAST-R coaches was helpful and contributed to their understanding of data and their ability to work with students. At the same time, while the intervention was implemented as intended (it was meant to be flexible and to provide as much or as little coaching to individual schools as administrators and teachers sought), it was not very intensive; the majority of survey respondents spent only one to five hours with the FAST-R data coach during the 2006-2007 school year. Moreover, comparison school teachers who took the survey reported receiving at least as much professional development as their FAST-R counterparts, were as likely to find it useful, and spent as much or more time analyzing data, including data from other (non-FAST-R) formative assessments. The impact analysis examines the effects of FAST-R on the reading test scores of third- and fourth-graders. FAST-R's impacts on student achievement--that is, the difference that FAST-R made over and above what was going on in the comparison schools--are generally positive but not statistically significant, as measured by MCAS reading scores. In other words, these differences could have arisen by chance. Effects on another measure of student reading, the Stanford Achievement Test, are more mixed but are also not statistically significant. While FAST-R schools put in place a particular model of data utilization, other BPS schools were pursuing similar goals, and this fact, along with the intervention's lack of intensity, may have undercut the likelihood that it would generate substantial and statistically significant impacts in this evaluation. Thus, this single study in a single district is not the last word on the potential of FAST-R. Much remains to be discovered about how teachers can best learn to use data to improve their instruction and boost the achievement of their students. Following an Overview, Preface, and an Executive Summary, this report is organized into four chapters. Chapter 3 discusses the professional development activities in FAST-R and non-FAST-R schools highlighted by the findings of the principal and teacher surveys. The chapter also considers how teachers perceived the utility of the FAST-R intervention for their instructional practices. Chapter 4 describes the findings from the impact analysis of FAST-R with regard to student achievement, exploring the range of student outcomes on the MCAS and the SAT-9 reading assessments. In addition, the chapter reports on an analysis to measure the impact of FAST-R on students' ability to make inferences and find evidence while reading. Lastly, subgroup analyses to compare the effect of FAST-R on various groups of students (by, for example, gender and socioeconomic status) are discussed. Chapter 5 presents the overall conclusions that may be drawn from the study's analyses and their implications for the use of formative assessments and data-driven instruction to improve reading skills. Appended are: (1) The Analytic Model Used in the FAST-R Impact Analysis; (2) List of FAST-R and Non-FAST-R Schools; (3) Subgroup Analyses of the Effects of the FAST-R Program; and (4) Sample of FAST-R Assessment Student and Teacher Materials.

AB  - Formative assessment is considered a promising approach to improving teaching and learning, especially in the Anglo-Arnerican literature. However, empirical evidence supporting this assumption is surprisingly weak. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of formative assessment by identifying the core components of formative assessment (assessment and feedback) and describing the way we assume formative assessment (via students’ perception) affects learning processes and outcomes. Furthermore, we present the project “Conditions and Consequences of Classroom Assessment” (Co2CA), consisting of four studies in which we successively investigated the design and impact of formative assessment in mathematics instruction: (1) In a survey study, we described current practice of classroom assessment in mathematics, as perceived by teachers and students, and developed mathematical tasks as a basis for the assessment component in the following studies. (2) In an experimental study, we investigated the impact of written process-oriented feedback on learning in an internally valid setting. (3) In an intervention study, we implemented the instruments and results of the first two studies in mathematics instruction to analyze the impact of formative assessment in an ecologically valid setting. (4) Finally, we conducted a transfer study to make our results usable in educational practice: We developed a teacher training in formative assessment and investigated its impact on teachers’ general pedagogical and pedagogical content knowledge. This chapter focuses on a description of the designs and selected results of Studies 3 and 4.

AB  - Abstract Although formative assessment is regarded as a promising way to improve teaching and learning, there is considerable need for research on precisely how it influences student learning. In this study we developed and implemented a formative assessment intervention for mathematics instruction and investigated whether it had effects on students' interest and achievement directly and via students' perception of the usefulness of the feedback and their self-efficacy. We conducted a cluster randomized field trial with pretest and posttest. The 26 participating classes were randomly assigned to a control group or the intervention group. Results of path analyses indicate that feedback was perceived as more useful in the formative assessment condition, self-efficacy was greater, and interest tended to increase; learning progress did not differ between the groups. The assumed indirect effects were partly confirmed: formative assessment showed an indirect effect on interest via its perceived usefulness. Highlights • Feedback in a formative assessment (FA) intervention is perceived as useful. • FA in mathematics has an impact on students' self-efficacy and interest. • FA has an indirect effect on interest via students' perception of its usefulness. • FA has a small indirect effect on achievement via students' self-efficacy. • No indirect effects via both intervening variables together were found.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of repetitions and questions (without feedback) at varying lags during self-paced learning from text. High school students read a series of unrelated paragraphs, each of which was repeated or tested after a variable lag. In a mixed condition, texts and repetitions of particular sentences were combined within paragraphs. Subjects were given free-recall and cued-recall tests one week later. In general, repetition did not improve performance. Correct answers to questions during the initial study task decreased as presentation-question lag increased. However, question-answering improved performance on the delayed tests substantially; the effect was constant over all lags studied. Question-answering produced better performance than repetition. Question-answering appeared to have operated primarily on memory traces of the information specifically tested. There was no evidence of any generalized attentional or strategy shifts or of any spread of effects to topically related information in memory. The effect of answering questions correctly appeared to have increased with increasing presentation-question lags. (Author)

AB  - After reviewing the conceptual bases and practical application of precision teaching, this analysis traces its evolution as the Sacajawea Plan, reports on its implementation in central Oregon school districts, and details the costs and procedures of adoption. Developed by Ogden Lindsley from B. F. Skinner's work in operant conditioning and extended through the Applied Behavioral Analysis methodology, the Great Falls Sacajawea Project comprises: (1) a screening procedure to identify students with basic academic skill deficiencies; (2) a means of continuously measuring student performance in basic skills necessary for learning; (3) a method for charting daily performance; (4) techniques for making decisions from charted performance; and (5) instructional support. The Great Falls Demonstration Project evaluated the effectiveness of precision teaching through a controlled study of six schools, and the project's developers concluded that the techniques produce statistically significant results inexpensively and are helpful to special and regular education students regardless of economic level. Interviews with Oregon teachers who participated in implementing precision teaching techniques in mathematics and reading instruction confirm that charting procedures were generally less rigidly followed after the initial year. Cited as factors in successful implementation are teacher dedication, administrative support, and economic conditions. Sample charts are appended. (MJL)

AB  - The target articles in the special issue address a timely and important question concerning whether practice tests enhance learning of complex materials. The consensus conclusion from these articles is that the testing effect does not obtain for complex materials. In this commentary, I discuss why this conclusion is not warranted either by the outcomes reported in the target articles or by the available evidence from prior research. Importantly, the weight of the available evidence does not alter the prescription for teachers and students to use practice testing to enhance learning of complex materials. However, the special issue highlights the need for more empirical and theoretical work on test-enhanced learning for complex materials, to further examine when and why these effects may be limited and to inform efforts to optimize test-enhanced learning for educationally relevant materials and tasks.

AB  - The current study investigated the use of a written recall procedure as a curriculum-based measurement of silent reading comprehension. Participants were five students in fourth and fifth grades in an after school reading program or an after school care program. An alternating treatments design was used to examine the utility of the written recall procedure in detecting small changes in silent reading comprehension as a result of a listening previewing intervention. Results indicated that the written recall procedure may be effective in detecting small changes in silent reading comprehension: however, further research is needed to determine the procedure's use as a curriculum-based measurement of silent reading comprehension.

AB  - The United States Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Germany adopted a single basal reading series including a management system involving periodic student skills mastery testing. Problem. Limited time was available for instruction and evaluation in reading. Criterion referenced skills mastery (magazine) tests were required periodically, but skills lesson tests used with every unit were optional. Purpose. The effect of differing assessment procedures on student achievement and its implications for the use of time and resources were the focus of this study. Procedures. The sample was eight second grade classroom units of teachers, only some of which used optional skills lesson tests. The different assessment procedures provided a natural experiment. Data were obtained from: structured teacher interviews; pupils' magazine test and standardized achievement test scores; attendance records; and sample lesson plans. The independent variable was the differing use of skills lesson tests. Reading achievement was the dependent variable and the factors which may have influenced it were control variables. Magazine test scores for comprehension, vocabulary, and phonetic analysis were compared for the groups experiencing different assessment procedures controlling for instruction level, chronological age, gender, and days absent. Findings. There were no statistically significant differences between the group that took skills lesson tests and the group that did not. Controlling for instruction level, chronological age, gender, and days absent also revealed no statistically significant differences. Conclusions. Different assessment procedures and time used do not affect students' reading achievement. Students apparently attain sufficient skills practice from instruction and workbooks. More testing was not better. Recommendations. Assessment testing should have a formative role in the reading program. Administrators, Reading Improvement Specialists, and teachers should be informed that giving skills lesson tests does not positively affect scores on magazines tests for second grade students.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act compelled states to design school-accountability systems based on annual student assessments. The effect of this Federal legislation on the distribution of student achievement is a highly controversial but centrally important question. This study presents evidence on whether NCLB has influenced student achievement based on an analysis of state-level panel data on student test scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The impact of NCLB is identified using a comparative interrupted time series analysis that relies on comparisons of the test-score changes across states that already had school-accountability policies in place prior to NCLB and those that did not. Our results indicate that NCLB generated statistically significant increases in the average math performance of 4th graders (effect size = 0.22 by 2007) as well as improvements at the lower and top percentiles. There is also evidence of improvements in 8th grade math achievement, particularly among traditionally low-achieving groups and at the lower percentiles. However, we find no evidence that NCLB increased reading achievement in either 4th or 8th grade.

AB  - Study Island is a practice and assessment tool that provides state-standards-aligned opportunities for students to practice their skills. It features a system of continual assessments with immediate feedback to adjust instruction and learning. When educators integrate Study Island into their instructional practices, it acts as a formative, ongoing assessment tool that provides students with a platform to practice or demonstrate their knowledge of taught standards. This approach reflects the elements of formative assessments as a process for monitoring progress and adjusting instruction. Research on formative assessment and progress-monitoring practices has demonstrated positive outcomes for student achievement (Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, & Kulik, 1991; Black & Wiliam, 1998; Fuchs & Fuchs, 1986; January et al., 2018; Stecker, Lembke, & Foegen, 2008; Stiggins, 1999; Van Norman, Nelson, & Parker, 2016; Wolf, 2007). Reading School District (RSD) is a current Study Island partner located 60 miles northwest of Philadelphia and with a total enrollment of over 17,000 students. Ninety-one percent of students in the district are economically disadvantaged, and 83% are Hispanic (Pennsylvania Department of Education, n.d.-b). As a district in Pennsylvania, RSD participates in the state's accountability system. The Pennsylvania Accountability System (PAS) holds schools and districts accountable to a range of measures, including participation rate, graduation or attendance rate, and closing the achievement gap for all students, especially historically underperforming students. As part of this accountability, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) is administered annually to students in grades 3 through 8 for English language arts (ELA) and math, as well as grades 4, 8, and 11 for science. Assessment data show that RSD tends to perform at levels lower than the state average. In support of RSD's partnership with Edmentum, this study is intended to provide a research basis for Study Island in terms of the research literature and analyses of RSD students' level of usage and performance data within Study Island compared to their performance on the PSSA. Through a series of descriptive and statistical analyses, which include pseudo-controls through Propensity Score Matching (a process to create quasi control and treatment groups of equivalent ability), the findings in this study suggest there are discernable and statistically significant positive impacts on PSSA scores for students participating in Study Island practice and Benchmarks. Generally, implementation and use of Study Island practice and Benchmarks in RSD vary by grade and content area. In practice, students appear to be answering a moderate number of questions and spending a fair amount of time using the product over the course of the school year. Grade 5, in both ELA and math, showed especially high use in the concentration of students using practice and the intensity of their usage. Where students spend more time, answer more questions, and spread their time over active weeks, positive differences are observed. These differences are evident in significantly different math mean scale scores and proficiency classification in grades 5, 6, and 7 when comparing users to non-users and the strongest users to the weakest. Statistically significant results are also found in grade 5 ELA. In addition, when students are exposed to the Benchmarks, which are widely used in grades 3-7 ELA and math, there is a strong and significant association between scores on the Benchmarks and scores on the PSSA. These significant observations remain even after controlling for student ability, based on students' prior-year PSSA scores. These analyses are clearly impacted by the quality and approach by which schools and teachers use Study Island practice or Benchmarks. Understanding the qualitative differences in implementation approaches, such as for grade 5 students, would be an important next step. Understanding these approaches will help guide implementations that drive evidence-based, positive outcomes for students. [The report was written by Edmentum Research.]

AB  - Study Island is a practice and assessment tool that provides state-standards-aligned opportunities for students to practice their skills. Study Island is a system of continual assessments with immediate feedback to adjust instruction and learning. When educators integrate Study Island into their instructional practices, it acts as a formative, ongoing assessment tool that provides students with a platform to practice or demonstrate their knowledge of taught standards. This approach reflects the elements of formative assessments as a process for monitoring progress and adjusting instruction. Research on formative assessment and progress monitoring practices has demonstrated positive outcomes for student achievement (Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, & Kulik, 1991; Black & Wiliam, 1998; Fuchs & Fuchs, 1986; Stiggins, 1999; Wolf, 2007). The district of Allentown, Pennsylvania (PA) is a current Study Island partner. As a district in PA, Allentown participates in the state's accountability system. The Pennsylvania Accountability System (PAS) holds schools and districts accountable to a range of measures, including participation rate, graduation or attendance rate, with the goal of closing the achievement gap for all students, and specifically for historically underperforming students. As part of their accountability, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) is administered annually to students in grades 3 through 8 for English Language Arts (ELA) and Math, as well as grades 4, 8, and 11 for Science (SC). In support of Allentown School District's partnership with Edmentum, this study is intended to provide a research basis for Study Island in terms of the research literature and analyses of Allentown students' level of usage and performance data within Study Island compared to their performance on the PSSA. Through a series of descriptive and statistical analyses, which include pseudo-controls through Propensity Score Matching, the findings in this study suggest there are discernable and statistically significant positive impacts on PSSA scores for students participating in Study Island Practice and Benchmarks. Generally, implementation and use of Study Island Practice and Benchmarks in Allentown varies by grade and content area. In Practice, students appear to be answering relatively few questions and spending minimal time over the course of the year. Where students spend more time, answer more questions, and spread their time over active weeks, positive differences are observed. This is evident in the grade 6 Math significant differences in mean scale scores and impact data. While not statistically significantly different, grade 6 ELA also shows some interesting differences in the method or approach to implementing Study Island Practice compared to other grades and content areas. In addition, when students are exposed to the Benchmarks -- in this case limited to Grades 7 and 8 for ELA and Math, and grades 4 and 8 for SC -- there is a strong and significant association between scores on the Benchmarks and scores on the PSSA. These statistically significant observations remain even after controlling for student ability, based on their prior-year PSSA scores. These analyses are clearly impacted by the quality and approach by which schools use Study Island Practice or Benchmarks. It would be an important next step to understand the qualitative differences in implementation approaches, such as for Grade 6 students. Understanding the methods will help guide implementations that drive evidence-based, positive outcomes for students. [This report was produced by Edmentum Research.]

AB  - This quasi-experimental study reports on the effectiveness of three assessment strategies for students’ performance. The primary goal was to determine whether there are any improvements in students’ conceptual learning when a frequent (weekly) quiz is used for grading purposes compared to using midterm and final examinations only. Another goal was to ascertain whether students perform better when they are allowed to work collaboratively on quizzes compared to students taking quizzes individually. The results showed that when the quizzes are open-book, and students have a chance to collaborate (discuss in pairs how to answer the quiz questions), they perform significantly higher in their final examinations and their final projects (an indicator of conceptual learning).

AB  - This research project focuses on the problem of the inappropriate assessment of primary grade students. The targeted group was first graders in a suburban elementary school. While taking tests, students revealed a low performance in comparison with their daily performance. They also exhibited frustration and a high stress level. Current research in assessment in education shows several causes for this problem, including reliance on traditional assessment methods. A variety of authentic assessment tools, such as portfolios and rubrics, were used to assess the first grade students more appropriately. The students benefited from the assessments and had a greater understanding of their own learning. The classroom teachers and parents also benefited from the implementation of authentic assessments, in that a more accurate portrayal of the student resulted. Postintervention data indicated a decrease in students' frustration and stress level during performance assessments as compared to that experienced during standardized achievement tests. Performance and authentic assessment results gave teachers and parents a clearer indication of the students' progress, while the results of the standardized achievement tests were not as useful. Ten appendixes contain surveys, rubrics, and other materials used in the study. (Contains 3 figures, 4 tables, and 19 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) has evolved as a reliable and valid method for measuring and monitoring student performance in basic academic skills. While the efficacy of CBM for assessing reading skills is not in question, issues remain regarding whether or not a difference exists between CBM probes derived directly from the instructional curriculum and generic probes. The current study extends previous research comparing the utility of two types of CBM reading probe materials. Both types of probes were administered to 13 second grade students twice weekly for 5 weeks. No significant differences were found between the two probe types' measurement of performance or progress over time, which suggests that school psychologists and educational professionals can use generic or curriculum dependent probes in curriculum based measurement.

AB  - The present study investigated the use of two alternative administration strategies for curriculum-based measurement (CBM) reading probes. This study expanded upon research by McCurdy and Shapiro (1992) that compared peer- and self-administration of CBM probes to typical teacher-administration procedures. Research has supported not only the reliability but also the positive intervention effects of peer- and self-directed assessment (Gettinger, 1985, 1995; Reid, 1996; Shapiro, 1996; Topping & Ehly, 1998). CBM implementation procedures in this study were selected to circumvent known CBM implementation barriers (Yell, Deno, & Marston, 1992) and maximize the benefits associated with peer-assisted learning and self-management strategies (Topping & Ehly, 1998; Shapiro, 1996). Results were used to answer questions regarding each strategy's (a) cost-effectiveness, (b) acceptability, and (c) ability to promote academic and self-efficacious growth. Findings supported the use of peer-administration based on comparable levels of administration accuracy, time requirements, teacher and student acceptability, student preference, oral reading fluency gains, reading comprehension gains, reading fluency rates of growth, teacher skill ratings, student attitude towards reading, and teacher perceptions of benefits compared to teacher-administration. Students spent a similar amount of time completing CBM using peer-administration as they did using teacher-administration with similar academic and self-efficacy gains. Peer-administration also has the potential to reduce time requirements to an even greater extent because it is not limited by direct teacher involvement. Based on this study, peer-administration is a viable alternative CBM administration strategy with the ability to maximize CBM's effectiveness.

AB  - This study aims to test the effects of essay tests and learning methods on students' chemistry learning outcomes. The sample of this study was drawn from grade 11 students at Jambi State Senior High Schools through a multi-stage random sampling technique. Within a factorial experimental design, the data were analyzed using the covariance analysis technique (ANCOVA) with Tukey's test. The experimental procedure was carried out using the requirement tests (e.g., normality and homogeneity). The results showed that Chemistry learning outcomes of the students, who were exposed to the use of higher contextual learning methods, were better than the control group, who were instructed with conventional learning methods. Also, the present study pointed to an interaction between the effects of formative tests and learning methods on chemistry learning outcomes when the influences of early skills were controlled. In light of these findings, the present study suggests that teachers use related teaching methods and essay tests to empower their students' learning processes.

AB  - The effects of overt, covert, and summary practice conditions on four levels of learning were examined. One hundred twenty-two middle class sixth-grade students were randomly assigned to practice condition. Passages about energy sources were read by the students and oral reviews were directed according to treatment. The summary group was given a review of relevant content, while covert and overt groups responded to adjunct questions. A 32-item selected response test contained 16 items from the practice booklet and 16 new items not practiced by any treatment. Data were examined on four dependent measures: repeated fact, new fact, repeated inference, new inference. The results show that oral summaries of relevant information can be as effective as inserted questions on immediate and delayed test performance. This study suggests that practice condition and question type may differentially affect learning and retention. (31 references) (Author)

AB  - Presenting college students, in a wide variety of content areas, with frequent announced and unannounced quizzes appears to correlate positively with enhanced test performance. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine if similar results can be achieved with high school students in a standard economics class. Based on a theoretical framework of operant conditioning and incentive theory, which emphasize the utility of positive reinforcement and motivation for repetition of behaviors, this study compared the unit test scores of students who had been subjected to announced and unannounced quizzes to test scores when quizzes were absent. Participants ( N = 40) were subjected to one of 3 quizzing patterns before the unit tests. Phase I was quiz-free leading up to the Unit 1 test. During Phase II, students took 10 brief, announced quizzes before the unit test, and during Phase III, 10 unannounced quizzes were given. After each phase, the achievement scores on unit tests were evaluated, and a "t" test was performed to analyze the impact, if any, of each type of quizzing pattern. Results showed that frequent announced and unannounced quizzing did not enhance student test scores. The research creates positive social change by further exploring environments where frequent quizzing is and is not advantageous at the secondary level. Further investigation and implementation of such assessment techniques, thereby producing enhancements in educational achievement, may create academic opportunities for high school learners as they pursue post secondary educational studies that have been heretofore beyond their reach.

AB  - Research in this study investigated the impact of assessment on the learning outcomes of students an academic year and the students' academic success on the Louisiana End-of-Course (EOC) test. This study utilized a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design that included a non-equivalent control group selection. Participants included students who live in a rural community and attend a high school located in a rural community. Existing test score data indicated that more than half of the students scored below average on the LEAP test for 8th grade and EOC for Algebra I. Research in this study investigated student success, motivation, and ownership of their learning in a rural community in the Southeast Region of Louisiana using self-assessment instructional practices. Self-assessment, a type of formative assessment, tells students how they need to improve their learning. Research in this study provides insight into self-assessment and the value it could add to teaching pedagogy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study was designed to determine the effect on learning achievement of formative assessment and correctives, the two components of the learning for mastery model considered by Bloom (1971, 1978) to be pivotal in changing learning behavior. Four experimental treatment groups of ninth and tenth grade students identified as below-average achievers were given a unit of instruction on inferential reading. All treatment groups were given four of the six components of the mastery learning model (specific objectives, pretest, group instruction, and posttest). In addition, one treatment group was given the formative assessment and correctives components; the second group was given the formative assessment component; the third, correctives; and the fourth, neither formative assessment nor correctives. It was hypothesized that students given formative assessments and correctives in combination (i.e., error-specific correctives) would attain higher scores on the unit test than students whose instruction excluded both these components, the correctives component only, and the formative assessment component only. The data were analyzed via ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple Range Test. The group receiving the total model outperformed to a significant level the groups whose instruction excluded formative assessments only or excluded both correctives and formative assessments. The total model group also outperformed the group whose instruction excluded correctives but not to a significant level. Therefore, the hypothesis was accepted with reservation. In interpreting the results of the study, the researcher questions the narrow definition of "corrective" associated with mastery learning and suggests that a class review of the formative test and correction of student responses are an effective feedback/corrective strategy. When correction is defined as a process rather than a product in an instructional unit, formative assessment becomes a feedback/corrective combination in itself. The findings of the study contribute to the body of evidence that mastery learning, and particularly the feedback/corrective process, increases learning achievement, in this case among ninth and tenth grade low achievers.

AB  - Taking a memory test not only assesses what one knows, but also enhances later retention, a phenomenon known as the testing effect. We studied this effect with educationally relevant materials and investigated whether testing facilitates learning only because tests offer an opportunity to restudy material. In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Formative assessments, which should be ongoing assessments, are used to guide educators as students learn as opposed to those assessments, often described as summative, that are used to evaluate learning at the end of a teaching cycle. Formative assessments are being used by many large school districts to alleviate the pressure of passing the state mandated test. The 2002 passage of the No Child Left Behind Act holds all educators accountable for every child, regardless of socioeconomic status, English language proficiency, exceptionality, race, or ethnicity. The intent of this study was to determine the effectiveness of Renaissance Learning formative assessments with 3rd and 4th grade at-risk learners. The study used data from five schools in a large urban school district. All receive Title I funds to support their educational programs. All students in the treatment group benefited from having access to the same district-wide curriculum and time allocation for reading and mathematics. All teachers of students in the treatment group administered the same district-wide formative assessment given to all students, regardless of status, in grades three and four. All 3 rd and 4th grade students in the study were administered the scheduled district-wide formative assessment, which is developed by Renaissance Learning. The diagnostic (pretest) was administered in the fall; the cumulative (posttest) was administered five months later. After the posttest, both data sets were analyzed. This study provides information that reveals or suggests that at-risk students who engage in Renaissance Learning formative assessments achieve respectable academic gains in reading and mathematics and good preparation for the annual state mandated test. This successful use of formative assessment to improve student learning is vital for any diverse, urban school district with a large population of at-risk students.

AB  - Among the types of assessment the closest to daily reading instruction is formative assessment. In contrast to summative assessment, which occurs after instruction, formative assessment involves forming judgments frequently in the flow of instruction. Key features of formative assessment include identifying gaps between where students are and where they need to go in their reading development; creating feedback loops that provide information about changes in performance gaps; involving students in meaningful, productive self-assessment; and charting from point A to point B to shape, mold, form reading development in the desired direction. Implementation involves developing a set of basic reading activities with clear success criteria and cultivating a learning-oriented culture in the classroom where students are willing to persist at improving their knowledge and skills. Effective formative assessment in reading instruction calls for knowledgeable teachers who are willing to develop and hone their assessment skills and practices in daily reading instruction.

AB  - The main focus of the research was to determine if the systematic use of formative assessment attributes had an impact on two affective variables—Academic Efficacy and Eagerness to Learn. Both the control and experimental students' affect was measured using a pre and post test administration of the Student Affect Inventory created by Popham and Stiggins (2008) in conjunction with the CCSSO. The post administration results of the experimental and control group were compared to determine if the systematic use of formative assessment attributes had a statistically significant impact on student affect. In addition, the pre and post test data of the experimental group was compared to determine if the systematic use of formative assessment attributes had a statistically significant change in reported affect by students as measured by the inventory. Inventories by all student participants (experimental and control) were examined for association between Academic Efficacy, Eagerness to Learn, Clear Learning Targets, and Progress Monitoring Information. The study utilized a quasi-experimental design along with a study of correlation. Student in the experimental group (N=12) received systematic formative assessment attributes in daily instruction for 18 weeks. The teachers in the experimental group received additional staff development and were to use formative assessment attributes systematically in their instruction. Students in the experimental group did not show a statistically significant change in inventory data. While the experimental group did exhibit some change, the population was too small (N=12) to show a statistically significant change. The results of the test of correlation of all student inventories (N=337) did show a strong statistically significant correlation between the affect variables and the formative assessment attributes. Additional research to examine impact of formative assessment attributes on a larger experimental population would be valuable. Additional research on the association of various formative assessment attributes with affect variables would add to the body of research in this field.

AB  - Teaching of mathematics at Slovak primary schools used to be based on the trans missive transfer of knowledge and skills from teachers to pupils. The currently used constructive and investigative approach in teaching mathematics in Slovakia requires a change in the formative assessment in mathematics based on the pedagogic experiment, which is carried out on a target group of respondents. The issue of measuring and evaluating pupils' performance is still topical for several reasons. Pupils' results in mathematics often do not meet the expectations among pupils themselves and their parents. Measuring pupil's level of knowledge and quality of education is also one of the topics that are very often discussed by the general public. We consider the use of formative assessment to correct teachers' teaching practices and pupils' learning practices as a suitable tool for the teaching process. This fact can be applied also in teaching mathematics. It helps to identify misconceptions in pupils' knowledge, to diagnose various problems and their causes in the learning process of pupils.

AB  - Today, computerization of the Assessment Program is a norm, numerous advantages of Computer-Assisted Assessment (CAA), both formative and summative, can be enlisted. Motivating students to systematic work and Self- Regulated Learning seems to be the biggest challenge faced by the teacher. This motivation can be reached by providing students with clear information that shows an evident effectiveness of formative quizzes, undisputable correlation between student engagement in taking formative quizzes and the final exam result. It is proposed to evaluate this effectiveness quantitatively in the field of Information Theory, using the Discrete Memoryless Channel description of relationship between the set of quizzes taken and the set of exam results. The Case Study is presented and if proves high correlation between these two sets.

AB  - THIS INTERIM REPORT COVERS ONE PHASE OF A BROADER PROGRAM AIMED AT STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF THREE EXPERIMENTAL MATHEMATICS PROGRAMS IN NINTH-GRADE ALGEBRA--BALL STATE, THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL MATHEMATICS (UICSM), AND SCHOOL MATHEMATICS STUDY GROUP (SMSG)--ON THE ATTITUDES AND INTERESTS PUPILS DEVELOP TOWARD MATHEMATICS. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 37 PAIRS OF NINTH-GRADE ALGEBRA CLASSES, EACH PAIR BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME TEACHER, AND UTILIZING ONE OF THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMS (E), IN ONE CLASS, CONVENTIONAL METHODS (C) IN THE OTHER. TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. TWO INSTRUMENTS, PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY OTHERS, WERE USED TO MEASURE INTEREST IN MATHEMATICS. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO DEVELOPED TO MEASURE THESE SPECIFIC ATTITUDE AND INTEREST FACTORS--(1) INTRINSIC INTEREST, (2) PERCEIVED KNOWLEDGE, (3) PERCEIVED UTILITY, (4) EXPERIENCED EASE OR DIFFICULTY OF LEARNING, AND (5) ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION. OTHER EVALUATION MEASURES THAT WERE USED WERE (1) SEQUENTIAL TESTS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS (STEP) TESTS, (2) EIGHTH-GRADE MATHEMATICS GRADES, AND (3) CONCURRENT YEAR, NINTH-GRADE MATHEMATICS GRADES. RESULTS, IN GENERAL, SHOWED LITTLE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT IN PUPIL ATTITUDES AND INTERESTS BETWEEN THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, A CONSISTENT TENDENCY WAS REPORTED FOR PUPILS IN THE BALL STATE PROGRAM TO DEVELOP LESS POSITIVE ATTITUDES, AND THOSE IN THE UICSM PROGRAM TO DEVELOP MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES THAN STUDENTS IN THE CONVENTIONAL PROGRAM. ALSO, IT WAS INDICATED THAT STUDENTS EXPERIENCED MORE LEARNING DIFFICULTY IN THE E PROGRAMS THAN DID STUDENTS IN THE C PROGRAMS. A LIST OF 12 REFERENCES IS INCLUDED. (DH)

AB  - The purpose of our research was to examine a web-based tool for mathematics progress monitoring in first grade. The newly developed assessment tool uses several robust indicators and curriculum-based measures forming three competences (Basic Precursors, Advanced Precursors, and Computation) to determine comprehensive early numeracy skills in regular education. 373 students completed a total of eight online tests every two or three weeks. Results indicate that delayed alternate-form reliability was adequate (r[subscript M] = 0.78). Repeated measures analyses with post hoc comparisons were used to ascertain the sensitivity to assess learning growth. All three competences showed linear growth rates that were significant over time, but only Computation and overall scores produced dependable increases from test to test. Predictive validity was determined using two standardised school achievement tests (end of first grade, end of second grade). Results indicate high predictive validity of the first four online tests (r[subscript M] = 0.67, r[subscript M] = 0.66 for 6 months and 18 months prediction). Correlations with teacher ratings of their students' skills confirmed this pattern. Results from student and teacher questionnaires indicate that the students were able to conduct the tests independently and that a three-week interval was adequate for regular-education use. Teachers stated to use the progress monitoring results diversely for classroom purposes. We conclude that the use of a web-based assessment setting with diverse measures is beneficial with respect to psychometric properties and feasibility for frequent use in regular education.

AB  - Testing students once a year, with data reported many months later, is like using an autopsy to determine how to help a patient, says Cindy Ambrose, chief academic officer of the Horry County Schools in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In Horry County and many other districts around the country, assessment that monitors vital signs on an ongoing basis is having a positive impact on student achievement. While educators in other schools worry about the amount of time spent on standardized testing each spring, those in districts committed to "formative" assessment frequently clamor for more testing of the sort that is usable for differentiating instruction and improving district programs. Using the sorts of assessment tools discussed in this article allows educators to monitor vital signs in two key areas: the health of the overall system and the needs of individual students. An equally important aspect of ongoing, formative assessment is the way in which it allows teachers to zero in and respond to the needs of individual students.

AB  - Can interleaved retrieval practice enhance learning in classrooms? Across a 4-week period, ninth- through 12th-grade students (N = 155) took a weekly quiz in their science courses that tested half of the concepts taught that week. Questions on each quiz were either blocked by concept or interleaved with different concepts. A month after the final quiz, students were tested on the concepts covered in the 4-week period. Replicating the retrieval-practice effect, results showed that participants performed better on concepts that had been on blocked quizzes (M = 54%, SD = 28%) than on concepts that had not been quizzed (M = 47%, SD = 20%; d = 0.30). Interleaved quizzes led to even greater benefits: Participants performed better on concepts that had been on interleaved quizzes (M = 63%, SD = 26%) than on concepts that had been on blocked quizzes (d = 0.35). These results demonstrate a cost-effective strategy to promote classroom learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this action research project was to afford teachers with data regarding their eighth grade students' current levels of proficiency on the New Jersey's mathematics standard. Through professional development, teachers were provided with the opportunity to use these data to create an instructional plan in which they could focus their instruction on the specific standards in which their students were not demonstrating proficiency. The data were collected through a comparison of student performance on the pre-assessment and post-assessment of the standards, interviews, questionnaires, and a leadership attribute survey. The first conclusion was that a formative assessment program had a positive effect on student proficiency of the mathematics standards. The second conclusion was that professional development had a positive effect on changing teachers' formative assessment practices. The third conclusion was that the researcher's leadership style had a positive impact on increasing students' proficiency of the mathematics standards.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness with which composition skills could be taught by the traditional theme-assignment approach and by an experimental method using weekly multiple-choice composition tests in lieu of theme writing. The weekly tests were based on original but typical first-draft compositions and covered problems of grammar, punctuation, usage, and organization. Students marked their answers on self-scoring answer sheets. An attempt was made to guide students in an orderly fashion in rewriting the theme, and the test items emphasized composition techniques that students can avoid in their free writing. The subjects were 306 grade 10 students in 14 different classes in two metropolitan school districts. Pretest scores indicated that the sample was relatively typical of grade 10 students. Criteria included scores on a standardized test and marks on a theme. Analysis of variance yielded non-significant F's for all tests of main and interaction effects. The findings are consistent with most prior research which indicates the difficulty of improving student writing skills at the high school level. However, the new method maintained student skills as well as theme writing did and required less teacher time. (Author)

AB  - Flipped instruction shifts the burden for engaging course content to the students. Moving these activities outside the classroom creates motivational challenges. This study investigates the role of formative assessments and completion rewards. Definitions are provided for flipped instruction and formative assessments. A classification of reward scores is offered to guide data collection in two field experiments. The study seeks to provide an empirical basis to guide use of completion rewards for flipped instruction classes. This study finds that completion rewards can increase quantity of formative assessment engagement. However, this change in quantity does not improve exam scores. The data suggests completion rewards may undermine the quality of engagement.

AB  - Background: Teachers who engage in formative classroom assessment using practices that accurately measure student learning should be better positioned to diagnose the instructional needs of their students and to act on that information. For this reason, there has been increased interest in formative classroom assessment in recent years. Although some researchers have found indications that some assessment practices may raise student achievement, evaluations of professional development programs designed to increase teacher assessment skill have not found differences in student performance. However, few studies of this type have been performed. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a professional development program in formative classroom assessment on teacher assessment knowledge and their students' achievement. Setting: The professional development program was implemented in state-identified, low performing middle schools from November 2005 through April 2008. Intervention: Researchers investigated a professional development program for teachers designed to increase their skill in creating and using assessments to support student learning. In Year 1, the professional development was implemented by an assessment coach in the treatment schools. No professional development was provided in the control schools. In Years 2 and 3, levels of treatment were investigated such that the professional development was implemented by an assessment coach or a relatively untrained facilitator. Research Design: Year 1 involved a multi-site, cluster randomized trial where schools were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. Year 2 and Year 3 involved a quasi-experimental design. Data Collection and Analysis: Researchers collected pretest and posttest teacher measures and analyzed the data using a split-plot ANOVA each year. Summative large scale assessment data was collected for students and analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Findings: Findings from this study indicate that the professional development program increased teacher assessment skill regardless of whether the program was implemented with a trained assessment coach or a relatively untrained facilitator. However, students of teachers participating in the professional development tended to demonstrate lower achievement than a matched set of students whose teachers did not receive the professional development. Implications for how teachers use assessment data to guide reteaching are discussed. (Contains 18 tables.)

AB  - The objective of this action research study was to explore the use of formative assessment (daily quizzes), including identification of student weaknesses or lack of understanding, along with instructional correctives that are different from previous instruction, to help students attain the intended learning goals. Part of the exploration was to determine if the use of this formative assessment focusing on "error types" improved student achievement. The analysis of the data from this study as compared to other "error type" studies supports the conclusion that student achievement does improve when systematic errors are identified from the formative assessment and analyzed. This data was then used to respond to individual learning needs. The majority of the errors studied resulted in improved student achievement after these errors specifically were addressed with focused instruction guided by the formative assessment.

AB  - Research has shown curriculum-based measurement (CBM) to be valid and reliable for a number of assessment purposes. This study provides school-based evidence of CBM validity for screening and placement purposes. CBM oral reading fluency and written expression scores for 465 students in Grades 6 and 7 were compared with theft year-end English and social studies marks received in Grades 8, 9, and 10. Correlation and regression analyses provided evidence of the predictive validity of CBM scores as Indicators of academic performance. Discriminant analysis procedures demonstrated the ability of CBM to differentiate between student groups of various proficiency levels. Overall, our findings supported the Inclusion of CBM scores, particularly oral reading fluency, in the assessment Information used to make special education screening and placement decisions.

AB  - In recent years, interest has spiked in data-driven decision making in education--that is, using various types of student data to inform decisions in schools and classrooms. In October 2008, the Council of the Great City Schools and American Institutes for Research (AIR) launched a project funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that focused on understanding the use of data as a lever for instructional improvement. The study was conducted in four urban districts located in geographically distinct areas. The project had two interrelated objectives: (1) to document and understand current data-use practices across urban school districts in terms of the use and availability of data--in particular, the administration and use of interim assessments; and (2) to generate empirical evidence regarding the relationships between student achievement and data-use practices at the school and classroom levels. To address the first objective, the authors administered surveys to district academic/curriculum coordinators and research directors to obtain a general overview of the state of current practices in using data to inform school- and classroom-level decision making across urban school districts. Following the surveys, the authors conducted a series of case studies of four urban districts, allowing for a more in-depth look at district data use. This report focuses on the second objective: examining the empirical relationships between teacher and principal use of student interim assessment data and achievement on end-of-year accountability tests. In this report, the authors expand on the existing body of literature on the use of interim assessments by examining the extent to which data-use practices (including perceptions about using data) are related to student achievement. The report is organized in three sections. First, the authors review the literature on using data from interim assessments and put forth a theory of action that undergirds their investigation. The theory of action identifies a set of key dimensions of data use and hypothesizes that supporting conditions in states, school districts, and schools can facilitate the effective classroom-level use of data to respond to students' instructional needs. Second, they report results of an empirical test of this theory of action. The analyses examined the relationship between teachers' and schools' use of interim assessment data and improvements in student achievement in reading and mathematics at grades 4, 5, 7, and 8. They focused on classroom-level data-use practices as reported by teachers, and school-level data-use practices and perceptions as reported by principals. The analyses include more than 1,500 teachers and 150 school principals and student achievement data from over 60,000 students across four urban districts collected during the 2009-10 school year. In the third and final section of this report, they interpret the study findings and provide recommendations and conclusions. Appended are: (1) District and State Context; (2) Measures and Data-Use Survey Items; (3) Information on Samples; and (4) Estimation Methods and Hypothesis Testing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if verbalizing while attempting to seek the solution to a typical reading comprehension question would enhance pupil performance on a standardized measure of reading comprehension. Sixty-one seventh graders from an urban public school were selected as subjects; fifty-one were randomly assigned to eight treatment groups and ten were assigned to a control group. All subjects were administered Form 1M, Level E of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test as a pretest measure. The treatment conditions were: (1) like materials with reinforcing comments and daily practice for five consecutive days, (2) like materials with reinforcing comments and only one practice, (3) like materials with non-reinforcement and daily practice, (4) like materials with non-reinforcement and one practice, (5) unlike materials with reinforcing comments and daily practice, (6) unlike materials with reinforcing comments and only one practice, (7) unlike materials with non-reinforcement and daily practice, and (8) unlike materials with non-reinforcement and only one practice. The results substantiated the use of verbalizing or thinking aloud techniques as an instructional procedure in the classroom, and practice efforts should be reinforced by comments from the teacher.

AB  - Abstract. The 1997 amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act contain provisions designed to increase the participation of children in special education in general education standards-based reform and accountability programs. The reading scores of 461 students with learning disabilities in a single district were followed across 5 years as the district implemented a state-mandated accountability plan and large scale testing program. The accountability program included grade-level proficiency standards for students and cash incentives for school staff to increase student growth. Student growth was assessed with a regression-based growth formula based on the typical progress of students across a school year at each grade. The district's performance with students with learning disabilities improved in terms of mean reading score and percent proficient in reading in elementary school across the 5 years. State standards for growth established in general education appeared to offer a challenging, but achievable, goal for special education services at the district level. However, measurement issues limit the use of growth standards at the school or individual level. The combination of large scale assessment and curriculum-based data linked to the large scale assessments offers the advantage of reliable and valid continuous progress measures for students in special education keyed to the higher expectations for performance and progress within general education.

AB  - 30 students (aged 8 yrs 6 mo to 9 yrs 5 mo) lacking subtraction skills received didactic instruction in subtraction and practice opportunities. 10 Ss monitored their own progress after each training session (self-monitoring), whereas 10 others had their progress monitored by an adult (external monitoring). A 3rd group received no monitoring. Results show that self- and external monitoring led to significantly higher percepts of efficacy, skill, and persistence compared with no monitoring. The 2 progress monitoring conditions did not differ significantly on these measures. The utility of self-monitoring procedures in actual classrooms is discussed.

AB  - The testing effect is a robust empirical finding in the research on learning and instruction, demonstrating that taking tests during the learning phase facilitates later retrieval from long-term memory. Early evidence came mainly from laboratory studies, though in recent years applied educational researchers have become increasingly interested in the effects of retrieval practice. We investigated the extent that the testing effect can also be observed and effectively used in psychology classes. Inspection of the research literature yielded 19 publications that tested the effect in the context of learning and teaching psychology. A total of 72 effect sizes were extracted from these publications and subjected to a meta-analysis. A significant overall effect size of d = 0.56 demonstrated that testing was beneficial to the learning outcomes. Further analyses focussed on the role of potential moderator variables, a possible publication bias, and the dependency between effect sizes. The results are discussed in the context of applications in learning and teaching psychology.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students’ concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers’ marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students’ concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students’ understanding with one student’s performance as a showcase. Teachers’ views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students’ conceptual learning.

AB  - Born from mandatory state-level high stakes assessment, more sources of student data are available to educators today than any other time in memory. School districts regularly employ some type of internal assessment system in order to understand how student populations are progressing towards expected outcomes. These assessments, often called interim assessments, are administered three to four times throughout the school year. How effectively teachers utilize these assessment data and its impact on student outcomes is the central focus of this study. This study utilized a quantitative design to understand if there is a predictive relationship between how teachers report the use of interim data and the student outcomes on year-end state-level tests.

AB  - If assessment is the purpose of testing, open-book tests may defeat the purpose. However, a goal of education is to build knowledge, and based on the literature, open-book tests may not be inferior to closed-book tests in promoting long-term retention of information. Participants studied Swahili-English pairs and either re-studied or took an initial quiz, which was cued recall or recognition in an open-book or closed-book format. One week later, the final closed-book recognition test showed higher performance in the quizzed conditions than in the study-twice condition, replicating the testing effect. However, performance was similar across the quizzed conditions, indicating that testing promoted long-term retention regardless of test format (open-book versus closed-book) and test type (cued recall versus recognition). Open-book tests are not inferior to closed-book tests in building knowledge and can be particularly useful in online classes because preventing cheating is difficult when closed-book tests are administered online.

AB  - This action research project focuses on increasing student comprehension and achievement. The study examined the effectiveness of completing detailed item analysis of assessments for the purpose of placing students into different Language Arts classes and learning groups within those classes. Research advocates placing students of similar ability levels for reading instruction as long as instructional practices are equitable. After student placement, the data was used then for instructional planning. Item analysis of weekly assessments and a unit test continued for the purpose of arranging learning groups and for instructional planning. The participants in this study consist of ten fifth-grade students. The students participated in lessons on a number of reading skills. Data were collected from fifth-grade Ohio Achievement Tests, Reading Benchmark tests, weekly assessments, a Unit Test, a reading survey, an interest survey, self-evaluation survey, conferences, and observational notes. The results of the study suggest a positive relationship between detailed item analysis and student placement. The results also show a positive relationship between using detailed data analysis for instructional planning and increasing student achievement. (Contains 16 charts.)

AB  - This article describes a statewide project in which weekly progress monitoring of mathematics was implemented with 120 special education students. Curriculum-based measurement probes for computation and concepts/applications skills were administered weekly over seven months. Students were assessed at levels identified as instructional by their teachers, and goals for performance were set based on recommendations from the research literature. Improvements of 0.38 digits per week (in computation) and 0.38 points per week (in concepts/applications) were found across students. A total of 66% of students achieved the expected goals in computation and 37% in concepts/applications. These levels of improvement were comparable to those reported in the literature for general education students. Perceived benefits and challenges of conducting progress monitoring in mathematics are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - THE EFFECT OF INTERIM TESTING ON THE IMMEDIATE ACHIEVEMENT AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETENTION OF COLLEGE SCIENCE STUDENTS IS EXAMINED. EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM TWO INTACT GENERAL SCIENCE CLASSES FOR STUDENTS OF TEACHER EDUCATION. BOTH GROUPS WERE TAUGHT ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND BONDING THROUGH THE USE OF PROGRAMED MATERIALS. RESULTS OF PRETESTS FOR READING LEVEL AND SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT WERE USED TO ESTABLISH ABILITY GROUPS. BOTH GROUPS WERE TESTED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL PERIOD, FOR SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT, AND 6 WEEKS LATER FOR RETENTION. FIVE INTERIM TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO ASCERTAIN STUDENT'S OPINIONS OF THE PROGRAM. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS USED TO COMPARE POST-TEST ACHIEVEMENT AND RETENTION TEST SCORES. STUDENTS IN THE AVERAGE AND LOW ABILITY SUBGROUPS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP MADE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES ON THE ACHIEVEMENT POST-TEST AND THE RETENTION TEST THAN DID STUDENTS IN SIMILAR SUBGROUPS OF THE CONTROL GROUP. EXPERIMENTAL STUDENTS IN THE HIGH ABILITY SUBGROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ON ONLY THE RETENTION TESTS. STUDENT OPINIONS INDICATED THEY PREFERRED PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION FOR CERTAIN COURSE UNITS.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of two levels of intensity (one lesson per day or two lessons per day) of a spelling intervention on students at risk for school failure. A quasi-experimental group design with random assignment was used. Elementary-level participants (n = 39) enrolled in a 4-week summer remedial program progressed through the study in homogenous groups. Student performance was assessed using both standardized and curriculum-based measures. Findings indicated no significant difference on standardized measures between or within participants across levels of intensity of spelling instruction. However, on curriculum-based measures, a significant difference was found within participants over time, but no significant difference was found between those who received one lesson per day and those who received two lessons per day.

AB  - Two types of objective tests quite frequently used are the true-false and the completion types. This article compared these tests to see which is the more valid measuring instrument and to discover any factors which might help in evaluating them for classroom use. Eight different experiments were performed, each involving a regular and an experimental class group. At the end of a period of study in a regular class, a test was given, consisting of twenty true-false items and twenty completion items. At the same time or later, this same test was given to students in an experimental class which had made no special study of the subject-matter covered by the test, to see what they could make on the test by guessing, bluffing, or using their general information. The principle underlying the whole procedure was that the better kind of test was that part of the total test which showed the more reliable difference in scores between the regular and the experimental classes. Results suggest that, while the completion test lacks objectivity, it is as valid as the true-false test and that the two should be used together to supplement each other by measuring different types of mental reactions.

AB  - Curriculum-based assessment (CBA) and curriculum-based measurement (CBM) procedures are increasingly being utilized to assess student academic skills for educational decision-making, including screening, progress monitoring, entitlement and intervention planning. At the same time, school districts are increasingly compelled to administer local and state standardized achievement tests to gather student performance data. Although the broad purpose of each assessment is the same--measure student performance within the instructional curriculum--there is usually very little understanding of the relationship between the assessment processes. With the media attention focused on local achievement test scores, little attention has been given to the role that CBM can have in predicting student performance on state and local achievement tests. Specifically, there have been relatively few attempts to establish CBM benchmarks--performance levels that can predict success on the local standardized assessment. Recent research to establish curriculum-based oral reading fluency benchmarks has been done in the states of Oregon and Alaska. The primary purpose of this study is to analyze data collected in a suburban school district in northeastern Illinois to evaluate the linkage between established CBM reading fluency benchmarks and state and local district standardized reading achievement in grades three through five. A secondary purpose of this study is to examine the predictive validity of CBM oral reading fluency relative to state and local reading assessments. Results of predictive validity studies demonstrate strong predictive validity for CBM Oral Reading Fluency measures relative to student performance on state and local standardized achievement tests. Analysis of the linkage between established oral reading fluency benchmarks and state and local assessment in Illinois demonstrates high utility for oral reading fluency benchmarks established in other states. Finally, this study suggests oral fluency benchmarks for fourth grade reading fluency that are linked to fifth grade high stakes achievement test performance. Contains 14 references, and 3 tables and 4 figures of data. (Author/RS)

AB  - In this report, an analysis is made of the Title 1 project of the Lorain City Schools in Northern Ohio. The language growth of an experimental group of 30 disadvantaged first graders, who had spent 45 minutes each day in a special language experience classroom, was analyzed using oral language recordings and extensive language tests in order to determine if significant language growth resulted and to determine what specific type of verbal growth could be identified. A second group of 30 disadvantaged first graders acted as a control group and was tested without benefiting from the daily language experiences. Selected tests from the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Metropolitan Readiness Tests, the Verbal Identification Tests, and the quantity of sustained verbal participation recorded by the Flanders Analysis of Classroom Interaction provided the raw data for the analysis. Seventeen language and readiness variables were statistically treated in the study. A correlation matrix was developed which contained all readiness, social, and personal variables. The study found that children in the experimental group performed at a level significantly superior to control children in sustained classroom speech, simple fluency, and labeling skills. Results showed that low readiness children can benefit by a compensatory program of language facility. (DD)

AB  - Although a number of interventions have been shown to be effective for improving students' oral reading fluency rates, significantly less research has been conducted to determine which interventions promote generalized reading performance to new texts. General case instruction (also called multiple exemplar instruction), in which teaching examples are carefully selected to sample from the stimulus and response variation, is a generalization programming technique that has been applied to myriad community skills but far fewer academic skills. The current study sought to apply this generalization programming strategy to promote generalized oral reading fluency. The study also sought to compare the efficiency (i.e., the amount of gains made in the amount of intervention time) of multiple exemplar instruction and a more typical listening passage preview/repeated readings intervention package. Participants consisted of 111 first and second grade students from three public schools in a large urban school district. One-way ANOVAs on the gain scores from pre-test to post-test were used to assess the effectiveness of multiple exemplar instruction, listening passage preview/repeated readings, and a time and attention control condition at promoting generalized reading fluency (in words correct per minute). Results showed that students in both the multiple exemplar group and the listening passage preview/repeated readings group outperformed students in the control group. Moreover, multiple exemplar instruction was more efficient. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study outlines a formative assessment system using a consistent set of cut scores on Curriculum-Based Measurement-Reading (CBM-R) probes and investigates four statistical methods for establishing cut scores. Cut scores were established using the Minnesota statewide achievement test in reading at grade 3 as the criterion for a successful outcome. Participants were 2,191 students from five districts in rural and outer-ring suburban east central Minnesota, each of whom completed the statewide achievement test in reading and also CBM-R probes between grade 1 and grade 3. This study examined the relationship between CBM-R and the state test and compared the utility and accuracy of each of four statistical methods for establishing cut scores. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis provided the most flexibility in establishing desired levels of diagnostic accuracy (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, and negative predictive power). The benefits of a set of consistent cut scores for use within a response to intervention (RTI) framework are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 7 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of school reform on student's academic achievement by analyzing the secondary data set before and after school reform has taken place. The longitudinal study examined student data over a three year consecutive period. In doing so, this study examined the relationship between school reform and student achievement in literacy and mathematics among African American students in the middle school. The three surveys of student's motivation, perception of school learning environment and perception of teaching effectiveness was administrated to the eighth grade students in school. The relationship between student motivation, perception of school learning environment, perception of teaching effectiveness, gender, parents' educational level and academic achievement was explored. The selected school has a large percentage of African American students, and was designated by New York State as Schools In Need of Improvement (SINI). A cohort of 145 African American eighth grade students' records was used for data analysis. The student socio-economic status, parent education and gender were treated as a covariate variable. Drawing from the tenets of the social cognition learning model, the cognitive learning theory, and the self efficacy theory were the underpinnings of this study. School reform was introduced via flexible scheduling, academic support and interdisciplinary teaching pedagogical practice and implemented for the 2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Through paired-samples t-test, a significant difference in English scores was identified throughout three year period. English scores improved across the three years from an average of 620.52 in 2006 to an average of 649.96 in 2007, and 676.99 in 2008. Math scores improved across the three years from an average of 611.30 in 2006 to an average of 641.32 in 2007, and 676.67 in 2008. Through repeated measure, a significant difference in Math and English scores was identified throughout the three-year time period. Results indicated a significant within-subjects effect for English and Mathematics. This mirrored the results from the t-tests which again indicated significant changes in English and Mathematics scores across the three years. Further, this provided strong support for the claim that school reform improves African American students' academic achievement in English and Mathematics in an urban middle school setting. Parent education, gender, and SES were included in these analyses as covariates, while the learning environment, teaching effectiveness, and motivation were the predictors. Through implementing multiple linear regressions, results attained through the regression models suggested that a significant relationship did not exist between student scores in English and Math scores from 2008 and with the model containing the three covariates and predictors. The information presented in this study assist educational leaders to identify factors that attribute to student achievement in African American students in urban middle school settings. This study also helps prepare our future leaders to use these predictors and/or create others based on their respective school communities to implement as strategies to improve academic improvement. Through examining the results of this study and identifying significant predictors, it is the researcher expectation that educators will use data to analyze, inform decisions and evaluate instructional and organizational practices while institutionalizing best practices to improve African American students' outcomes in middle schools.

AB  - Despite the emerging evidence base on response to intervention, there is limited research regarding how to effectively use progress-monitoring data to adjust instruction for students in Tier 2 intervention. In this study, we analyzed extant data from a series of randomized experimental studies of a kindergarten supplemental reading intervention to determine whether linking performance on formative assessments to curriculum progression improved kindergarten reading outcomes over standard implementation. We were interested in whether specific progression adjustments would enhance the effects of supplemental reading intervention. Growth-mixture modeling using data from kindergarteners (n = 136) whose intervention progression (e.g. repeat lessons, skip lessons) was adjusted every 4 weeks based on mastery data identified four latent classes characterized by unique profiles of curriculum progression adjustments. Multilevel analyses comparing the performance of students in the four classes with that of propensity matched groups whose intervention was not adjusted (n = 101) indicated positive effects of curriculum progression for (a) students whose formative assessment performance exceeded 90% and received early and sustained lesson acceleration and (b) students who initially performed below 70% on assessments and who repeated early lessons and progressed to conventional implementation. Effects of curriculum adjustments for the two smallest groups were less clear.

AB  - The effect of collaborative testing on junior high school students' scores was investigated. Twenty-two students in grades 7, 8, and 9 were given curriculum-based tests in their pre-algebra classes. Some tests were taken individually in the traditional manner, and others were taken collaboratively by students in pairs over a 10-week period. Collaborative and individual scores were compared, and collaborative test scores for 1990 were compared with individual test scores for 1989. A questionnaire was administered to the subjects to determine their reactions to collaborative testing. Questionnaire results indicate that all students preferred the collaborative testing. Test scores showed a mean improvement of 9% over the 10 weeks, while the previous year's students, tested traditionally, had dropped 5% during the same time period. These findings indicate that: collaborative testing offers an effective way of improving achievement in certain classes, and student attitudes toward classes can be positively affected by collaborative testing. The study questionnaire and two tables of test results are appended. A 42-item list of references is included. (Author/SLD)

AB  - Results from the fall 1987 administration of the Cognitive Skills Assessment Battery (CSAB) to 3,203 kindergarten and 4,415 first-grade students within the Charleston County (South Carolina) School District are presented. The CSAB is an individually administered readiness test that comprises a hybrid of aptitude tests, diagnostic tests, and achievement tests. The CSAB measures readiness for first grade prior to movement to that level, assesses 12 of 18 statewide kindergarten objectives as part of the Basic Skills Assessment Program, provides detailed instructional information about each student's performance on each objective tested, and measures some previous learning. The CSAB requires 20-30 minutes for administration to each child. It is not a paper-and-pencil test; rather, it is composed of orally-administered items to which the child usually responds by pointing to pictures, manipulating objects, and answering questions orally. This report presents: (1) district-wide results for both grade levels; (2) comparisons of district results with state results for first graders; (3) breakdowns of the district's first-grade results by demographic characteristics of the students (including gender, ethnicity, handicapped status, repeater status, income, and kindergarten experience); (4) historical results for district first graders for 1985, 1986, and 1987; and (5) percentages of district first grade and kindergarten students scoring ready, borderline, and not ready on each CSAB objective for 1985, 1986, and 1987. District CSAB data demonstrate an increase in readiness levels among entering first graders; although, readiness scores between 1985 and 1987 have remained relatively constant for the district and state. The greatest relative increases from kindergarten to grade 1 appeared for ordering and fine motor skills; however, objectives analysis for these two grades show a leveling effect. (TJH)

AB  - Evaluated the mathematics achievement effects of principal components of mastery learning and student team learning in a year-long randomized experiment with 588 9th graders. The components were formative tests, corrective instruction for nonmasters, summative tests (mastery), and practice in 4-member heterogeneous teams, and team rewards (teams). A 2 × 2 (mastery by teams) factorial experiment compared mastery, teams, teams + mastery, and a control treatment. All methods used the same materials and schedule of teaching, worksheets, and test. A nested ANCOVA indicated significant achievement main effects for teams but not for mastery. No mastery by teams or pretest by treatment interactions were found. Results support the instructional effectiveness of team work and team rewards characteristic of R. E. Slavin's (1983; also see record [rid]1984-07975-001[/rid]) method of student team learning.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine if a decrease of cognitive load expectancy associated with weekly spelling assessment would result in better performance on outcome measures. The theoretical basis for this study is the Information Processing Theory of Cognitive Psychology, which proposes that the human brain has a limited capacity. Presently, there is a concern regarding the decline in spelling scores on standardized tests across the country. Educators and parents are interested in innovative techniques to provide an alternative to traditional spelling instruction that has been ineffective for decades. That is why spelling instruction was chosen as the academic interest in the present study. Twenty-seven fourth grade students volunteered to participate in the six-weeks study. The students were randomly assigned to three different groups and two of the three groups received spelling instruction. The light cognitive load with instruction condition received half the words on Monday and was tested on Wednesday. They received the remaining half of the list on Wednesday after a test on the first half and were tested on the second half of words on Friday. The heavy cognitive load with instruction condition received all the words on Monday and was given an assessment on Friday. The control group was also given the entire list on Monday for one weekly assessment on Friday. The two conditions that received instruction met three times each week for thirty minutes to receive instruction and assessments. The control group also met with the researcher but was left alone to study without help. Two hypotheses were proposed for this study and were evaluated with a Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) and a priori orthogonal contrasts to evaluate differences among the groups. Additional follow up analyses were conducted using a sign test. The a priori orthogonal contrasts revealed no statistically significant difference among the three groups for the levels of the independent variables (i.e., cognitive load and Fernald). The results of the sign test revealed a statistically significant difference for the cognitive load variable but not the Fernald instruction variable.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether comprehensive post formative assessments can accurately predict student academic achievement on AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress) indicators as measured by standardized criterion-referenced tests. The primary participant populations for this study were sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students enrolled in a middle school in north Georgia from 2004-2007. Over 2,900 student assessments were used to conduct the statistical research and variables such as gender, race, and socio-economic levels were not disaggregated in the data collection compilation. The data sources included the first quarter, second quarter, and third quarter post formative assessments which are administered every nine-week grading period in the school system. The findings indicated that various grade levels exhibited a higher predictability factor with certain quarterly assessments than others. Likewise, unit gains on post assessments demonstrated a statistically significant indicator for academic achievement on high stake standardized assessments.

AB  - The development of quality educational programs, designed to meet the needs of all students, is a pivotal responsibility of educators and yet a considerable challenge due to the diverse needs in each school. Many consider the Response to Intervention (RtI) model to be one initiative with the greatest potential to improve education for all students (Tilly, 2006). RtI is a process that screens students for concerns, uses scientifically based strategies to teach, intervenes to address identified learning needs, assesses and charts progress, and ultimately adjusts the educational support to meet the varied needs of all learners (Dickman, 2006). A vast majority of RtI research has focused on elementary models; however, there is a need for research regarding RtI at the secondary level. It is likely that students benefiting from RtI at the elementary level may require similar supports in middle and high school. This mixed method study was designed to consider the appropriateness of implementing progress monitoring, a component of an RtI model, in a middle school setting. The study measured the reading growth of sixth grade students following the implementation of a systematic progress monitoring program and examined teachers' perceptions regarding the impact of this program on student achievement, instructional decision-making, and the classroom learning environment. Sixth grade student reading scores were compared prior to and following the implementation of the progress monitoring program. Additionally, data from classroom observations, teacher responses to reflection questions, and teacher interview responses were analyzed to measure the perception of teachers regarding the effectiveness of implementing class-wide progress monitoring. The results indicated that student achievement was positively impacted by the systematic progress monitoring program without interruption to the learning process. The qualitative data from teachers provided insight and recommendations to further aid in the development of an appropriate middle school RtI model. The quantitative data provided evidence to support the benefit of allocating additional time and energy to the development of a model that supports continued screening, monitoring, and intervening to support the learning needs of students across the educational continuum.

AB  - Retrieval practice improves meaningful learning, and the most frequent way of implementing retrieval practice in classrooms is to have students answer questions. In four experiments (N=372) we investigated the effects of different question formats on learning. Students read educational texts and practised retrieval by answering short-answer, multiple-choice, or hybrid questions. In hybrid conditions students first attempted to recall answers in short-answer format, then identified answers in multiple-choice format. We measured learning 1 week later using a final assessment with two types of questions: those that could be answered by recalling information verbatim from the texts and those that required inferences. Practising retrieval in all format conditions enhanced retention, relative to a study-only control condition, on both verbatim and inference questions. However, there were little or no advantages of answering short-answer or hybrid format questions over multiple-choice questions in three experiments. In Experiment 4, when retrieval success was improved under initial short-answer conditions, there was an advantage of answering short-answer or hybrid questions over multiple-choice questions. The results challenge the simple conclusion that short-answer questions always produce the best learning, due to increased retrieval effort or difficulty, and demonstrate the importance of retrieval success for retrieval-based learning activities.

AB  - This research was designed to examine the difference in student performance between minority magnet school students who live in the residential area for those magnet schools and minority students assigned to a non-magnet residential school. This difference in performance was measured by scale score differences from the North Carolina End-of-Grade tests in reading and math after the sample scores were converted to z scores using the state mean and standard deviation for the given years in the study. Performance growth was measured for students who were in the third grade in 2009-2010 and remained at their school through the fifth grade in 2011-2012. Participants used in the study were selected based on their race, the size of the school they attended, the percent of minority students attending that school, and whether they lived in the residential boundary for their school. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to import and evaluate data received from the district's accountability department. A mixed, two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine the data through multiple independent variables and the dependent variables of math and reading tests. A mixed, two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that there was a p value of 0.007 for groups over time, where the magnet and zone schools performed differently. A univariate, repeated-measures ANOVA of math scores determined that there was no statistically significant interaction between the groups over time in math. However, the same univariate analysis, when performed for reading scores, showed a p value of 0.005, meaning the type of school may have impacted the achievement of the students in the study.

AB  - Study of the practice effect observed in the repetition of a test. The children in 10 sixth grades in the schools of Cambridge, Mass., were given the Dearborn Group Intelligence Test and the National Intelligence Test with an interval of one week between the two testings. The results indicate that where the same group test was repeated, the practice effect was fairly large. Where another form of the same test was given the practice effect was smaller. Where an entirely different test was given after the week interval a practice effect could be demonstrated, but was smaller than those of the other two situations.

AB  - In this small-n study, six kindergarten students identified as having low phonological awareness skills/average lexical retrieval (LPA/ALR) and low phonological awareness/low lexical retrieval (LPA/LLR) skills participated in a metacognitive/phonological awareness and letter/sound instructional program. The study examined the responsiveness of children categorized as LPA/ALR and LPA/LLR using Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (phonological awareness measures of Onset Rime Fluency (ORF) and Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF)). Six students were provided with phonological awareness and letter/sound instruction. All students were provided with seven weeks of instruction three times a week in segmenting, blending, and procedural and conditional metacognitive knowledge (how, when, and where to apply these skills) and why these skills were important. Also, students were provided with letter/sound instruction for two weeks on a daily basis that included metacognitive/conditional knowledge about this skill. Students were assessed with PSF and ORF measures two times a week for seven weeks during metacognitive phonological awareness training. Students were assessed with PSF and ORF measures two times a week for two weeks during letter/sound training. In order to assess students' ability to maintain phonological awareness skills, students were assessed with PSF and ORF measures three times a week approximately two and five weeks after the instruction was completed. Students participated in four phases in a one-week time-lagged format: (a) A condition (baseline), in which the researcher read stories to students on an individual basis, (b) BC condition, in which they were provided with explicit metacognitive instruction in blending and segmenting skills, (c) D condition, in which they were provided with explicit metacognitive instruction in letter/sound skills, and (d) E condition, in which students were assessed using ORF and PSF measures, and the Comprehensive Phonological Processing Test (CTOPP; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999). There were six baselines in this study. Two of the baselines consisted of students with a cognitive profile that indicated low phonological awareness/average lexical retrieval (LPA/ALR). The remaining four baselines consisted of students with a cognitive profile that indicated low phonological awareness/low lexical retrieval (LPA/LLR). The first week of instruction, two students, one student from each cognitive profile, began individual training. The second week of instruction two additional students, one from each profile, began training. The third week of instruction, one student with the LPA/LLR profile began instruction, and the fourth week, one student with the LPA/LLR began instruction. Results indicated that the metacognitive phonological awareness and letter/sound training did not appear to impact students' performance on the ORF and PSF measures. There appeared to be no significant differences between students categorized as LPA/ALR and LPA//LLR, although one LPA/LLR student's performance trend on the PSF measure indicated slower progress compared to the other students. Students' performance on the Phonological Awareness Subtest of the CTOPP indicated that all students performed in the average range at posttest. Five students indicated average performance on the Rapid Naming Subtest of the CTOPP at posttest; however, one student's performance remained unchanged. Also, a comparison of students' performance on the ORF and PSF measures in August with their performance on these measures in January indicated improved performance.

AB  - A major purpose of this research was to measure the effect of four different teaching processes on lower and higher mental process achievement. Two separate studies, one in science and one in mathematics, involved approximately 100 seventh grade students in four classrooms in a public junior high school in a middle-income neighborhood, and 85 ninth grade junior high school students in a low-income neighborhood, respectively. Teachers of junior high level science and mathematics were trained to use higher mental process questions, with a goal of making at least 33 percent of questions asked higher mental process questions. Mastery learning procedures were incorporated in which students received feedback on their formative tests followed by corrective procedures and by parallel formative tests, which also included at least 33 percent higher mental process questions. Instructional material that posed higher mental process questions, problems, and illustrations were also used. Comparisons with students in control classrooms indicated that the experimental student groups made significant gains in higher and lower mental process achievement. Data from both studies support the hypothesis that student achievement is a function of the degree to which teaching processes used by a teacher provide adequate opportunities to learn higher mental processes. Three data tables and four figures are included. (CB)

AB  - We describe findings from a series of longitudinal studies utilizing a response to intervention framework implemented over 3 years with students in Grades 6 through 8 with reading disabilities and poor reading comprehension. Students were identified based on reading comprehension scores in Grade 5 (n = 1,083) and then randomized to treatment or comparison conditions. Beginning in sixth grade, students assigned to intervention were provided treatment for 1, 2, or 3 years based on their response to instruction in each preceding year. Screening procedures, progress monitoring tools, tiers of instruction, and findings from each year of the study are reported. Additional studies investigating reading and behavioral outcomes through multi-level, growth modeling, and studies of the cognitive and neural correlates of inadequate response are also reported.

AB  - One goal of education is transfer: the ability to apply learning in contexts that differ from the original learning situation. How do we design opportunities to promote transfer in a large lecture course? Studies have shown that learning is enhanced when 1 or more tests are included during learning (the testing effect, e.g., Roediger & Karpicke, 2006) and when study sessions are distributed over time (the spacing effect, e.g., Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006). Furthermore, research on analogical reasoning suggests thinking about abstract principles in multiple superficially different exemplars is critical for transfer. Our quasi-experimental study evaluated whether spaced analogical reasoning questions (delivered via clickers) would improve transfer over a 10-week course. Students in 2 sections of an introductory psychology course were presented with low stakes testing opportunities during every class session of a term. Although both sections used clickers, the Testing group received an additional 1–3 analogical reasoning questions per week designed so that students would apply the same abstract concept (correlation/causation) in a new context (e.g., prenatal growth, literacy). The Notes group was presented with equivalent information in a direct instruction format. To assess long-term transfer, transfer questions were embedded into the midterm and final exam. The Testing group outperformed the Notes group on transfer in the final exam. This indicates that practicing analogical transfer is particularly important for delayed test situations. The current research provides unique insight into the how formative assessment can produce long-term transfer of abstract concepts with current pedagogical technologies.

AB  - In this paper, we describe an effort to develop and evaluate an innovative formative assessment to gather evidence about middle school students' argumentation skills. Specifically, this game-enhanced scenario-based assessment (Seaball—Semester at Sea) includes a series of argumentative reasoning activities in the context of an extended scenario wherein students debate the issue of whether junk food should be sold to students. These activities were designed around argumentation learning progressions (i.e., hypotheses about the qualitative shifts that occur as students achieve higher levels of sophistication in argumentation) which serve as a framework to determine the targeted skills, levels and activity sequences. Performance feedback is also provided in the assessment. We conducted a pilot study, aimed at examining student performance and the validity of the tasks as a measure of argumentation skills. More than 100 middle school students completed this assessment and additional external measures of argumentation in a pre/post design. Descriptive statistics of student performance in the activities, analyses of item difficulty, and correlations are reported. Results indicated that students' total scores were significantly correlated with external measures of argumentation skills, and with students' state reading and writing test scores. In addition, students achieved higher average scores in a post-test of argumentation skills after having completed the Seaball activities. Finally, explanatory feedback about students' task performance was found to be beneficial to those who were "Below" or "Approaching" proficient on the state reading and writing test. We conclude with implications for assessment design and instruction in argumentation.

AB  - The aim of this research is to set forth the effects of formative assessment methods on reading comprehension. To this end, reading status of a group of students was assessed with formative assessment methods, while that of another group was evaluated with traditional ones. The research was carried out by using unequalised quasi-experimental design. The experimental and control groups of the research were randomly assigned. The study group consisted of 50 3rd grade students of a primary school in the Dilovasi district of Kocaeli city, Türkiye. The data of the study were obtained from the texts within 3rd grade curriculum and from the comprehension questions prepared for these texts. The data were analyzed via SPSS 22 program. Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used during analyses. In the findings of the research, a highly significant difference was observed in favor of the experimental group. As a result of the findings of the research, it was observed that formative assessment methods contributed to reading comprehension success positively

AB  - AbstractWe present the results of a meta-analytic synthesis of the literature on the association between the use of frequent low-stakes quizzes in real classes and students’ academic performance in those classes. Data from 52 independent samples from real classes (N = 7864) suggests a moderate association of d = .42 between the use of quizzes and academic performance. Effects are even stronger in psychology classes (d = .47) and when quiz performance contributed to class grades (d = .51). We also find that performance on quizzes is strongly correlated with academic performance (k = 19, N = 3814, r = .57) such that quiz performance is relatively strongly predictive of later exam performance. We also found that the use of quizzes is associated with a large increase in the odds of passing a class (k = 5, N = 1004, odds ratio = 2.566).

AB  - This paper is based on the deliberations of the Assessment Working Group at EDUsummIT 2015 in Bangkok, Thailand. All of the members of Thematic Working Group 5 (TWG5) have contributed to this synthesis of potentials, concerns and issues with regard to the role of technology in assessment as, for and of learning in the 21st century. The group decided to focus primarily on formative assessment rather than summative assessment and high stakes testing. Formative assessments and feedback provide an important opportunity to support and enhance student learning. Recognizing shifts in education towards blended and online learning with problem-based and inquiry-based approaches led to considerations of technologies that could effectively support formative assessment and informative feedback to 21st century learners. The paper concludes with a summary of conclusions and recommendations of the working group to be taken up in subsequent efforts.

AB  - Progress monitoring is a method of keeping track of children's academic development. Progress monitoring requires frequent data collection (i.e., weekly) with technically adequate measures, interpretation of the data at regular intervals, and changes to instruction based on the interpretation of child progress. This report presents two cases that illustrate how progress monitoring data could be used to make reasonable decisions about children's responsiveness. The first case shined a light on reading problems that may have been overshadowed by behavioral issues, while data in the second case indicated that the child needed more than what could be delivered in general education.

AB  - In this paper, the authors estimate the effect of a high school exit exam requirement (relative to no requirement) on students' academic achievement, persistence in high school, and graduation rates. They are particularly interested in the effects of the policy on the students who have low initial skill levels in high school. The study is based on data from four large California districts--Fresno, Long Beach, San Diego, and San Francisco Unified School Districts--to investigate the effects of failing the California High School Exit Exam. These are four of the eight largest school districts in California, collectively enrolling over 110,000 new high school students (about 5.5 percent of high school students in the state) annually. They use three years of longitudinal data from students who were in 10th grade in the Spring of 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 (i.e., they use data from 2003-2008).

AB  - In this study, the authors examined whether a test-enhanced learning program, integrated with daily classroom practices, is effective in a middle school setting. Specifically, they implemented and experimentally evaluated a test-enhanced learning program in 6th-8th grade Social Studies, English, Science, and Spanish classes. Although laboratory studies documenting the benefits of quizzing on learning and retention are prominent, prior to their work little experimental work has assessed the effects of quizzing in classroom settings. The absence of classroom experiments relating to the testing effect represents a critical gap in extending the basic work to educational practice. In the typical laboratory experiment, the testing effect is demonstrated for material that subjects are exposed to once and for which they have no further access for review and study. Further, even when target material is educationally relevant (e.g., a text), it is an isolated passage not related to integrated content like that representing a classes' educational objectives. By contrast, material learned in a classroom context is seen under very different circumstances. The material is typically reinforced in homework and reading assignments, it is designated as important for the students to master, and the material is part of an integrated topic domain identified as core to the curriculum. To remedy this critical gap in verifying that the basic testing effect work can translate to effective educational practice, their ongoing work has focused on experimental evaluation of the effects of quizzing on learning course content in classroom settings. Their past three years of research at Columbia Middle School (CMS) have shown powerful positive effects of quizzing on student performance on chapter exams, semester exams, and even on final examinations given at the end of the school year.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to design a rigorous experimental study and collect high quality data to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on student achievement. In particular, the authors examined whether diagnostic assessments implemented by schools in Indiana produced rigorous estimates of their effects on student performance on the state's annual Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress-Plus (ISTEP+) measures. Because the data were produced from a well designed randomized experiment they have high internal validity and justify causal inferences about the intervention effects (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). In addition, because their sample included numerous schools (58 schools) from different school districts in Indiana their results should have higher external validity than those from convenient and localized samples. To account for the nesting of students within schools the authors employed two-level models to examine the effectiveness of the intervention. The experiment took place in Indiana in 2009-2010 and included K-8 schools that had volunteered to be part of the intervention the Spring of 2009. The authors used data from the first year of the experiment for grades K through 8. They conducted analysis on the initial number of schools that were randomly assigned to conditions (Intention to Treat or ITT) and on the participating or TOT (Treatment on Treated) schools. The outcome was mathematics scores of ISTEP+. The findings overall suggested that across all grades (K to 8) the treatment effect was positive, but it was not as large and not significantly different from zero. As a result, it seems that the type of diagnostic assessment that Indiana implemented in the sample of schools they evaluated did not improve mathematics achievement that much. The same conclusion holds for the results using grades K to 2 and 3 to 8. However, the within grade analysis revealed that in fifth grade mathematics the treatment effect was significant and not trivial. The treatment effect was consistently as large as one-fifth of a standard deviation and indicated an important annual gain in mathematics achievement. All other estimates were not consistently significant and depended on the specification. Hence, it is unclear that the intervention had any systematic effects on student achievement except for fifth grade mathematics. The estimates produced from the TOT analysis indicated significant treatment effects. However, it is likely that the TOT estimates are biased due to selection and therefore they are not as internally valid as those produced by the ITT analysis.

AB  - The use of summative testing to evaluate students' acquisition, retention, and transfer of instructed material is a fundamental aspect of educational practice and theory. However, a substantial basic literature has established that testing is not a neutral event--testing can also enhance and modify memory (Carpenter & DeLosh, 2006; Hogan & Kintsch, 1971; McDaniel & Masson, 1985; see Roediger & Karpicke, 2006, for a review). Such findings suggest that educators might exploit testing (e.g., no- or low-stakes quizzing) as a technique to promote learning, not just as a way to assess learning. Converging on this suggestion, a number of quasi-experimental and correlational studies have demonstrated that no- and low-stakes quizzing can enhance performance on course assessments relative to no quizzing, for both online quizzing (Angus & Watson, 2009, Daniel & Broida, 2004; Kibble, 2007) and in-class quizzing (e.g., Leeming, 2002; see Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, & Kulik, 1991, for a review). The authors thought it possible that low-stakes quizzing in the classroom might also prompt deeper or more complete learning of the course material, such that performance on course summative assessment items that required transfer of the tested information would be enhanced relative to no quizzing. To examine this possibility, the authors conducted three experiments in an authentic classroom situation in which performance on the summative examinations used to evaluate the students (and assign grades) served as their dependent measures. Of interest was the extent to which in-class quizzes (with feedback) would enhance performance on summative exams, especially when quiz items are related to, but are not identical to, items on the summative exam. Echoing the variety of transfer effects produced by testing (quizzing) reported across the tantalizing but limited available experimental work (see Rohrer et al., 2010), the present study was designed to explore a range of possible transfer from quizzed items to exam items. As an overview, Experiment 1 focused on the extent to which quizzing would produce associative transfer, and Experiments 2a and 2b examined the effects of quizzing on learning and retention of related information and application of target constructs. Results demonstrate that low- and no-stakes quizzing can promote learning that is deeper than just retaining a particular answer. Experiment 1 clearly showed that quizzing promoted transfer to different exam items requiring a reverse association between concept-term and definition from that quizzed. Experiments 2a and 2b further showed that quizzing promoted transfer from applying a principle/concept in a concrete context to better retention of definitional information, as well as to applying the principle in a new context. This transfer was relatively broad, ranging from associative transfer, to increased learning of definitional information (after applied questions), to application of concepts in a variety of situations. Thus, quizzing can enhance learning of science concepts, not just learning of particular answers to repeated questions (across quizzes and exams). As such, low- or no-stakes quizzing appears to be a valuable learning technique that could be incorporated in a wide variety of educational contexts, without extensive changes or adjustments to current classroom practice and teacher development.

AB  - The Multilevel Assessment of Science Standards (MASS) project is creating a new generation of technology-enhanced formative assessments that bring the best formative assessment practices into classrooms to transform what, how, when, and where science learning is assessed. The project is investigating the feasibility, utility, technical quality, and effectiveness of formative assessments, summative assessments and the Learning Management System (LMS) developed in the SimScientists program. The MASS project is funded by IES and has the following goals: (1) Use systematic design principles to create formative assessments with technical quality to be used during (embedded) and at the end of (benchmark) science curriculum units; (2) Use systematic assessment principles to create a coherent, multilevel state science assessment system by aligning (1) the items within the embedded assessments and the items within the benchmark assessments with the student, task, and evidence models used to design them (horizontal alignment), and (2) the designs of the embedded and benchmark assessments and items with state science standards and relevant items on the state science test (vertical articulation); (3) Study the relationship of the formative assessments and activities to student learning; (4) Study the validity of the use of data from the embedded and benchmark assessments for interpreting student performance on the targeted science standards; and (5) Describe the components of the formative assessments and their implementation so that they can serve as scalable models. The pilot test involved 5,867 middle school students in Spring 2010. This population is from a range of small to large schools and districts, including rural, urban, and suburban districts, a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and includes English learners and students with disabilities. In the field test, approximately 800 middle school students are participating in Spring 2011; an additional 500-800 middle-school students will participate in Fall 2011. These populations are from a large school district, a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and include English learners and students with disabilities. The simulation-based assessments studied in this project could contribute to the coherence, comprehensiveness, and continuity of a state science assessment system. Comprehensiveness would be improved by using simulation-based unit assessments to add measurements of science standards for integrated system knowledge and active inquiry practices. Continuity would be improved by the multiple measures unit benchmark assessments could add to state science assessment reports. Coherence could be forged by a nested set of simulation-based assessments in the form of curriculum-embedded modules for formative uses, unit benchmark assessments for summative proficiency, and use of the unit benchmark data or tasks in district or state science testing.

AB  - Around the world during the last decade, policymakers increasingly emphasize the use of data in education to enhance student achievement. As a result, the number of reform initiatives to promote "data-based decision making" (DBDM) or "data-driven decision making" (DDDM) has increased rapidly. At the University of Twente in the Netherlands, a DBDM intervention was developed in which whole school teams participate in the training. In 2011, a first group of 53 elementary schools participated in this DBDM intervention and showed promising results. In 2012, a new cohort of schools started the intervention. The study reported on in this abstract was aimed at evaluating the intervention effects of this new cohort of schools. Data for this study were gathered from 40 elementary (K-6) schools in the Netherlands which participated in the DBDM intervention from August 2012 until July 2014. Student achievement data covering the period August 2010 until July 2014 were retrieved from schools' student monitoring systems. A multiple single-subject design was used to investigate the effect of this DBDM intervention on student achievement growth, and to investigate patterns in DBDM effectiveness based on background variables at both the school and the student level. Each school was measured repeatedly over time, before the intervention period (the control phase) and during the intervention period (the treatment phase). Findings revealed that a significant intervention-effect was found for both spelling and mathematics. This study revealed that mathematic outcomes improved especially for low-SES schools. Tables and figures are appended. [SREE documents are structured abstracts of SREE conference symposium, panel, and paper or poster submissions.]

AB  - Cognitive scientists have recommended the use of test-enhanced learning in science classrooms. Test-enhanced learning includes the testing effect, in which learners' recall of information encountered in testing exceeds that of information not tested. The influence of incentives (e.g., points received) on learners who experience the testing effect in classrooms is less understood. The objective of our study was to examine the effects of incentives in a postsecondary biology course. We administered exams in the course using a quasi-experimental design with low and high point incentives and measured student learning. Although exposure to exams predicted better learning, incentive level did not moderate this effect, an outcome that contradicted recent laboratory findings that higher incentives decreased student recall. We discuss possible explanations of the disparate outcomes as well as the implications for further research on the testing effect in postsecondary biology classrooms.

AB  - The article deals with the decision of Westwood Elementary School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to implement electronic individualized, frequent assessments to accurately measure the achievement of students. Electronic individualized assessments do double duty. They determine what a student can and can't do, and then point the way to the appropriate instruction. The school's principal, Jan Borelli uses a variety of assessments, including Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills, Riverside Publishing's Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests, district benchmark exams aligned to state standards, mini-assessments with the district's Edusoft software and Learning Letter Sounds for students in kindergarten and first grade.

AB  - Over the past 15-20 years, research has indicated that teachers who utilize curriculum-based measurement (CBM) to make instructional changes in their students' programs when warranted by poor performance patterns effect greater overall achievement among their students than do teachers who neglect to use systematic progress monitoring procedures. Furthermore, special education teachers who engage in their own forms of progress monitoring appear to change instructional programs infrequently, if at all, over the course of the year. This investigation contributed to previous research by separating the effects of simply making instructional changes, not based on student performance data, from the effects of making instructional changes in accordance with CBM data. Thus, teachers' effectiveness when implementing instructional changes in response to individual CBM data was contrasted with their effectiveness when implementing the same instructional modifications with students whose progress was not monitored with CBM. Teachers selected 42 pairs of students with learning disabilities and emotional disturbances for participation in the 20-week study. Teachers monitored the mathematics performance of one student from each pair using CBM. Instructional decisions were based on this student's progress; however, teachers implemented the same instructional changes for both the CBM student and his or her partner. Two related purposes of the study were to examine the effects of computerized consultation and the effects of frequent measurement on student achievement. Consequently, half of the teachers received a form of computerized consultation for instructional decision making, and half of the partners engaged in CBM tasks, although their teachers never saw partner data. Results indicated that the CBM students performed significantly better than their partners whose instructional changes were not based on CBM data. However, no difference in achievement was noted between students whose teachers did or did not receive computerized instructional consultation. Similarly, frequent mathematics measurement failed to affect student achievement significantly.

We describe experimental-contrast studies in reading and mathematics in which teachers used CBM to monitor student progress and to make instructional decisions. Overall, teachers' use of CBM produced significant gains in student achievement; however, several critical variables appeared to be associated with enhanced achievement for students with disabilities: teachers' use of systematic data-based decision rules, skills analysis feedback, and instructional recommendations for making program modifications. In general education, positive effects for CBM were associated with use of class profiles and implementation of peer-assisted learning strategies. Implications for instructional practice and future applications of CBM are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is an ongoing debate among instructional personnel, parents, legislators, and the community at large about the nature and purpose of testing in the educational system. State and district-based testing programs have been criticized as "over-testing" policies. The result of the criticism culminates in a reduction of assessment program implementations--either being removed or significantly scaled back with a corresponding decrease in available student information used to lead instruction, evaluate district initiatives, or predict future student performance. This study shows progress monitoring, or interim, test usefulness and appropriateness by examining student performance scores on locally-created interim tests for middle school science courses and compare them to student performance scores on the state-wide standardized summative test to determine the predictive validity while controlling for student, class, and school characteristics. The result is a statistically significant model that predicts student success on the state science exam based on aggregated student progress monitor scores.

AB  - In the current climate of high-stakes testing in education, the academic achievement of students is the highest priority among American schools (NCLB, 2001; Education Alliance, 2005). However, student achievement is often dictated by performance on formal, summative assessments and state testing assessments rather than informal, formative assessments and progress as observed and evaluated by the teacher. As such, curriculum pacing guides often drive elementary classroom instruction as opposed to the pace of student learning. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate the assessment methods of elementary students to provide them with opportunities for multiple attempts to master content. DuFour (2004) stated that the priority for teachers should not be just ensuring that students have been taught the content; they should be concerned with whether they have learned the material and can apply the skills. Recent discussion among scholars proposes that students be afforded the opportunity to continuously demonstrate their understanding of the content since most students do not learn at the same rate or through the same methods (Wormeli, 2006; Brookhart, 2004). Research shows that gender may impact learning (Gurian, 2001; Pomerantz et al., 1997) and that academic performance can differ by race (Brooks-Gunn, McLanahan, Rouse, 2005; Jencks, Phillips, 1998; Fordham, Ogbu, 1986). The multiple attempts at mastery philosophy is a school-wide assessment practice in which students have the opportunity to continuously prove their mastery through a variety of assessment formats, such as oral testing or adjusted test length. Students resubmit assignments and retake alternative assessments to improve their grades and demonstrate their understanding of the curriculum. Remediation must take place prior to any re-assessment so that students and teachers can work together to address learning obstacles. The teacher assigns an alternative assessment, or re-do, of the assignments or assessments previously submitted. This study assessed the impact of the multiple attempts at mastery philosophy' based on student performance on the Language Arts and Mathematics sections of the Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS) exam. The PASS exam is administered at the end of each school year for students in grades 3-12. The target population for this study included 549 fifth-grade elementary students from an upstate school district in South Carolina. The study consisted of students at Elementary School TA, which utilized a traditional grading practice. Additionally, students from Elementary School MAAM were included in the study, where the multiple attempts at mastery philosophy was used. Nine research questions were addressed in this study: I. Is there a significant difference in Mathematic academic achievement between students who experienced multiple attempts at mastery than that of their peers who experienced traditional grading policies as assessed on the Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS) exam? 2. Is there a significant difference in Language Arts academic achievement between students who experienced multiple attempts at mastery than that of their peers who experienced traditional grading policies as assessed on the Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS) exam? 3. Is there a significant difference in the Mathematic Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS) exam results of the male and female students who experienced multiple attempts at mastery and those who did not experience the multiple attempts at mastery philosophy 4. Is there a significant difference in the Language Arts Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS) exam results of the male and female students who experienced multiple attempts at mastery and those who did not experience the multiple attempts at mastery philosophy? 5.

AB  - A key tool in multitiered systems of support is the use of curriculum-based measures to predict which students are at risk for academic failure. However, there are few studies that examine which measures are most suitable for students in middle school. The authors examine the reliability of predicting outcomes on state assessments for 3 commonly used curriculum-based measures at the middle school level. Data were collected from a middle school in the Midwest that regularly administers 3 different curriculum-based measures. Reading Curriculum-Based Measure (R-CBM), Maze, and Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC) were given to students in Grades 7 (n = 238) and 8 (n = 256). Logistic regression was used to examine each measure in predicting outcomes on the Michigan Education Assessment Program Reading assessment. Results indicated that MCRC more accurately predicted outcomes than R-CBM or maze (Grade 7 eβ = 1.75, Grade 8 eβ = 1.68). Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - 40 daily matching objective type tests were given to students in a course in general psychology. The scores made by the 173 students with complete records were divided consecutively into 8 blocks of 5 each. Cases were then arranged into quartiles according to average score for semester. Mean block standard deviations were computed for the individuals in each quartile. Variability of scores increased from the highest to the lowest quartile (rho = - .90). This relationship also held true for individual variability and average scores (r = - .40 ± .04). From this it would appear that daily testing stimulates learning-morale and interest in course subject matter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this presentation discussed in this brief abstracted report, the author presents about an ongoing partnership with the Philadelphia School District (PSD) to implement and research the Ongoing Assessment Project (OGAP). OGAP is a systematic, intentional and iterative formative assessment system grounded in the research on how students learn mathematics. The program is being implemented and studied as a mixed method randomized control trial of OGAP impacts in grades 3-5 in Philadelphia area schools. In the spring of 2014, CPRE recruited 60 schools (including charters) in the Philadelphia area to participate in the research study of OGAP. These schools were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, stratified by charter school and district. The formal research study of OGAP is designed to address the following five central research questions, which are broken down into three implementation questions and two impact questions: Implementation questions include: (1) How do teachers understand the OGAP formative assessment process and use it in their daily practice?; (2) Is the frequency and sophistication of teachers' use of OGAP associated with greater increases in mathematical knowledge for teaching or ability to interpret evidence in student work?; and (3) Is the frequency and sophistication of teachers' use of OGAP associated with greater student learning? Impact questions are as follows: (4) Does teachers' use of OGAP increase mathematical knowledge for teaching and ability to interpret evidence in student work? What moderating factors affect this relationship?; and (5) Does teachers' use of OGAP significantly improve student performance on both proximal and distal student outcome measures? What mediating and moderating factors affect this relationship? The presentation includes a brief description of the study and year one experimental impacts on teachers and students.

AB  - Research in the area of elementary mathematics has been limited in recent years. Direct instruction methods, including drill tasks, have been recommended for elementary students who have mathematics difficulties. This project involves two studies that examined the effectiveness of a specific direct instruction intervention, Folding-In, on the math computation achievement of elementary students. Weekly Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) progress monitoring data, as well as achievement test data, were used to monitor the effectiveness of the intervention, with improvements noted in math fact fluency in both a university-based clinical tutoring and a classroom intervention setting.

AB  - Retrieving information from memory can--under many circumstances--strengthen one's memory of the retrieved information itself. The strategic use of retrieval to enhance memory and help long-term retention is known as retrieval practice. However, it is unclear whether its effect also holds true in the case of learning mathematics. This research is an exploratory case study, where we test a method-- using test-enhanced learning as formative assessment--in a high-needs vocational school. Since the literature on how this method works in classroom settings in mathematics is limited, the purpose of our case study was to get a better view and to lay the groundwork for further experiments. The experimental group and one of the control groups were from the vocational school, while the other control group was from an elite grammar school. On the final test members of the experimental group outscored their schoolmates and reached statistically the same scores as the control group from the elite grammar school. By means of the method, we were able to reduce the performance gap in long-term retention between students from the elite grammar school and students from the urban high-needs school.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the evolution of collaborative practices of PLCs as they emerge when using technology based formative assessment via iFAIT or innovative Formative Assessment with Instruction and Technology developed by the researcher using audience response systems and the online data compiler, Eduphoria!. This study used sequential explanatory mixed methods to address the problems that schools face when implementing technology based formative assessments to improve instruction and student achievement. A survey administered in September 2012 and again in December 2012 provided a measure of teacher use of formative assessments, technology use in formative assessments, and perceptions of teachers using the PLC as a mechanism of support for technology based formative assessment. Training was facilitated by the researcher as PLCs worked together to develop, administer, and interpret formative assessments. Teacher interviews were conducted, and the study ended with the administration of the December 2012 survey and open-response questions for further qualitative analysis. Quantitative data analysis was completed using ANOVAs to determine if there were significant differences of teacher groups (subject taught, grade level taught, and years of teaching experience) use of iFAIT. This data analysis also included measures of frequency and paired sample t tests between the September and December 2012 responses. Qualitative data was analyzed using hand coding, word clouds, and WordSmith Tools. The triangulation of qualitative data in the quantitative data provided a narrative to document what collaborative factors affected the use of iFAIT. For school improvement and implementation of iFAIT, the study revealed that (1) with the right technology infrastructure, on-going professional development must be offered by administrators or sought after by teachers; (2) teachers must have strong beliefs in formative assessment and the technology that supports it; (3) open lines of communication must be supported through the PLC and administration; (4) teachers must see purpose in using revealing student data to drive instruction; and (5) PLCs must have common beliefs and believe that student achievement is connected to school improvement. PLCs should discuss data, share successes, and plan instruction through extended involvement in face-to-face and online venues as communities of practice.

AB  - Several previous studies have indicated that secondary school students face problems in digital situations. Digital citizenship is therefore an essential conception for fostering students' correct behaviour and safe daily life habits while using computer and communication technologies. However, scholars have indicated the challenges of promoting students' digital citizenship owing to the lack of opportunities to situate them in decision-making situations. The advancement of computer and multimedia technologies has encouraged an increasing number of studies on digital game-based learning, which provides students with opportunities to experience various situations, and to cope with problems encountered in daily life. Several previous studies have indicated that digital game-based learning environments with proper learning strategies might help students realize the importance and meaning of digital citizenship. To address this issue, this study proposes a formative assessment-based contextual gaming approach to guide students to make decisions and to monitor their learning during the gaming process. A digital game-based learning environment was developed based on this approach, and a quasi-experiment on the digital citizenship topic was conducted in northern Thailand to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhanced the students' digital citizenship behaviours, but also promoted their motivations and perceptions. • A formative assessment-based contextual gaming approach was proposed. • The approach fosters positive effects on students' scores of digital citizenship for using online communication. • An experiment was conducted in an ICT course of a middle school. • The approach decreased the students' online harassment behaviours. • The approach improved the students' learning motivations and perceptions.

AB  - The purpose of this mixed methods collective case study was to determine the use of formative assessment data generated by the web-based program Study Island in the planning and implementation of instruction. The study utilized quantitative data collected through teacher surveys then triangulated qualitative teacher focus group and individual teacher interview data in order to establish statistical themes for narrative analysis. The research focused on data generated by the Study Island program at three rural middle schools, Grades 6 through 8, located in the western region of North Carolina. The need for data to help teachers determine the next steps for instruction drove the implementation of Study Island in the school system in which the study was being conducted. Data compiled from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and from the North Carolina end-of-grade tests showed that there were still schools that did not have all students functioning at grade level. This data, in addition to concerns expressed by the administration of the schools in the study about teacher use of the data justified the purpose of this study. The increased focus on using data to drive instructional decision making led to the addition of several types of computer-assisted instruction, including the web-based program Study Island, in the three schools studied. The results from the study led the researcher to conclude that although teachers did not have a positive or negative perception of use of Study Island and the data generated by the Study Island program overall, they had a positive perception of use when it came to using the program with students. The researcher’s recommendation was for the district to pursue training with regards to the use of the Study Island program, the use of the data generated by the Study Island program, and formative assessment.

AB  - Effective instructional materials can be valuable interventions to improve student interest and achievement in science (National Research Council [NRC], 2007); yet, analyses indicate that many science instructional materials and curricula are fragmented, lack coherence, and are not carefully articulated through a sequence of grade levels (AAAS, 2001; Schmidt et al., 2001). In order to improve student achievement in science, school districts need evidence about the efficacy of instructional materials so they can make sound decisions about their science programs. In addition, science education researchers and curriculum developers can benefit from a better understanding of the characteristics of instructional materials and PD that promote student achievement. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an intervention that consists of research-based multidisciplinary science curriculum materials for high school students and curriculum-based professional development (PD) for teachers using the materials. The study took place in traditional high schools the state of Washington. Approximately half of the schools were in rural settings in central Washington, the other half were in suburban settings in western Washington. The study sample included nearly 4,000 ninth and tenth grade students nested within 18 high schools. The teacher sample within these 18 schools included 54 teachers. Ninth and tenth grade science teachers in nine treatment schools received curriculum materials and seven days of curriculum-based professional development for each of two years. Teachers in nine comparison schools continued to use extant instructional materials and receive extant professional development (i.e., business-as-usual). A cluster-randomized trial design (Raudenbush et al., 2002) was used where schools were randomly assigned to treatment conditions. Findings showed that research-based science instructional materials with supporting curriculum-based PD have a strong positive effect on classroom instruction and a modest but noteworthy effect on student achievement. One figure is appended.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a curriculum-based intervention for high school science students. Specifically, the intervention was two years of research-based, multidisciplinary curriculum materials for science supported by comprehensive professional development for teachers that focused on those materials. A modest positive effect was detected when comparing outcomes from this intervention to those of business-as-usual materials and professional development. However, this effect was typical for interventions at this grade span that are tested using a state achievement test. Tests of mediation suggest a large treatment effect on teachers and in turn a strong effect of teacher practice on student achievement--reinforcing the hypothesized key role of teacher practice. Tests of moderation indicate no significant treatment by demographic interactions.

AB  - Directions used in curriculum-based measurement of reading (CBM-R) currently ask students to "do your best reading." The purpose of this study was to examine whether varying these verbal directions would affect CBM-R performance and whether these alternative directions would influence the important relation between CBM-R performance and reading comprehension. Previous studies have varied in their findings, though they also varied in the alternative verbal directions they used and in their methodology. Third-grade students (N = 104) from two schools that differed in terms of their demographic characteristics were randomly assigned to one of two sets of direction conditions used in previous research. Results from a mixed between-subjects/within-subjects factorial analysis of variance found that, regardless of school setting, CBM-R performance was significantly influenced by one set of directions but not by the other set of directions. Possible methodologic explanations for these differences in results, as well as implications for practitioners, are discussed.

AB  - Retrieval-based learning has been investigated in various populations. The present study examined retrieval-based learning in a sample of students at a special-needs school with educational tracks for learning and mental development. In addition, a comparison group of students at a regular school was examined. Learning conditions were manipulated within participants. In a first session, participants either received restudy cycles only, or they received alternating test and restudy cycles. A second session then comprised the opposite form of practice. In both sessions, a final test assessed memory after a short distractor phase. This procedure was the same in two experiments but with different kinds of item material. For both kinds (images and image-word pairs), a testing effect occurred, that is higher recall of tested items. These results show that lower cognitive ability or lack of experience with regularly being tested in school do not prevent students from benefiting from retrieval-based learning.

AB  - The research on interim assessments is inconclusive (Goertz, Olah, & Riggan, 2009b). A confounding issue on the use of interim assessments is the use of commercially available interim assessments. The purpose of this quantitative, causal-comparative study was to determine the difference of language arts performance scores among middle school students from a southeastern U.S. school district. Two research questions framed the study. The first overarching question examined the difference in student performance when a district implements locally developed and aligned interim assessments, and the sub-question examined the performance of students of different ability levels. The study used the formative feedback system model as a conceptual framework (Halverson, Prichett, & Watson, 2007). A general linear model approach was used for a repeated measures analysis of covariance to determine if the use of interim assessments was statistically significant, while controlling for initial differences on control variables (Weisberg, 2014). The data included three years of Grades 6-8 language arts scale scores for a convenience sample of 2,037 students. Student absences, gender, socioeconomic status, English language learner status, exceptional student education status, teacher advanced degree status, and teacher experience were used as control variables. The results were positively statistically significant with a moderate effect size of .57, which translates to more than half a school year of growth (Coe, Kime, Nevill, & Coleman, 2013). The results contribute to the research on interim assessments, inform stakeholders on the efficacy of interim assessments, and inform educators on the best types of interim assessments.

AB  - Background: Test frequency, stakes associated with educational tests, and feedback from test results have been identified in the research literature as relevant factors in student achievement. Objectives: Summarize the separate and joint contribution to student achievement of these three treatments and their interactions via multivariable meta-analytic techniques using a database of English-language studies spanning a century (1910–2010), comprising 149 studies and 509 effect size estimates. Research design: Analysis employed robust variance estimation. Considered as potential moderators were hundreds of study features comprising various test designs and test administration, demographic, and source document characteristics. Subjects: Subjects were students at all levels, from early childhood to adult, mostly from the United States but also eight other countries. Results: We find a summary effect size of 0.84 for the three treatments collectively. Further analysis suggests benefits accrue to the incremental addition of combinations of testing and feedback or stakes and feedback. Moderator analysis shows higher effect sizes associated with the following study characteristics: more recent year of publication, summative (rather than formative) testing, constructed (rather than selected) item response formats, alignment of subject matter between pre- and posttests, and recognition/recall (rather than core subjects, art, or physical education). Conversely, lower effect sizes are associated with postsecondary students (rather than early childhood–upper secondary), special education population, larger study population, random assignment (rather than another sampling method), use of shadow test as outcome measure, designation of individuals (rather than groups) as units of analysis, and academic (rather than corporate or government) research.

AB  - In the present article, we present a systematical review of previous empirical studies that conducted formative assessment interventions to improve student learning. Previous meta-analysis research on the overall effects of formative assessment on student learning has been conclusive, but little has been studied on important features of formative assessment interventions and their differential impacts on student learning in the United States' K-12 education system. Analysis of the identified 126 effect sizes from the selected 33 studies representing 25 research projects that met the inclusion criteria (e.g., included a control condition) revealed an overall small-sized positive effect of formative assessment on student learning (d =.29) with benefits for mathematics (d =.34), literacy (d =.33), and arts (d =.29). Further investigation with meta-regression analyses indicated that supporting student-initiated self-assessment (d =.61) and providing formal formative assessment evidence (e.g., written feedback on quizzes; d =.40) via a medium-cycle length (within or between instructional units; d =.52) were found to enhance the effectiveness of formative assessments.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of peer-assisted learning strategies (PALS) and curriculum-based measurement (CBM) on the mathematics performance of secondary students with disabilities. Ten classes with 92 students in Grades 9 through 12 participated. All students were significantly below grade level and received mathematics instruction in self-contained resource rooms. Classrooms were randomly assigned to PALS/CBM or the classroom mathematics program (control). PALS/CBM was implemented twice weekly and CBM was conducted weekly for 15 weeks. PALS/CBM students improved their computation math skills significantly more than control students, but no significant difference was found on concepts/application math skills. On questionnaires, teachers and students indicated that they (a) liked using PALS, (b) felt PALS was helpful in increasing mathematics skills, (c) thought CBM graphs increased motivation to work hard in math, and (d) would like to participate in PALS/CBM again. Results are discussed with respect to research and practice.

AB  - Testing frequency has long been examined in the social sciences as an antecedent to student performance in the classroom. However, after nearly 70 years of study, the results are inconclusive. Given the developments in computerized testing over the last decade, professors now have the ability to create and conduct frequent tests without severely impinging on other duties. In this article, the authors reexamine the issue in a marketing context, and the findings suggest that, under certain conditions, students tend to perform better with more frequent testing. In addition, more frequent testing tends to increase student evaluations of faculty. The authors also discuss reasons for and limitations of these findings.

Data were analyzed from 2,357 students in teachers' classrooms who had participated in a year-long professional development program on mathematics formative assessment, 1,427 students from teachers who had participated in the program in the year prior, and 9,783 students whose teachers had not participated at all. Analyses indicated that all students in the treatment group demonstrated growth, and that student achievement was influenced by the number of times the assessment was used to collect data and make instructional decisions. Further, there was a relationship between districts' socioeconomic status and growth, meaning students from impoverished backgrounds grew more than their peers.

AB  - In article the approach to optimization of formative and summative assessment by optimum scores item difficulties during carrying out of adaptive test is described. This optimisation is based on connection of the Vygotsky's concept about zones of learner's development and mathematical models of the modern theory of tests - Item Response Theory. By this connection some inequalities are resulted, which are allowing to allocate items for maintenance of learner's development during formative assessment and to minimise the measurement error at carrying out summative assessment. This inequalities are supplemented with the personal characteristic curves illustrating zones of learner's developmen. The steepness of personal characteristic curve constructed by means of two-parametrical model, is interpreted as parametre of learner's structure knowledged.

AB  - This study extended the work on curriculum-based measurement to examine the criterion-related validity of curriculum-based measures in written expression for middle school students, the differences in validity coefficients for various lengths of text, and the sensitivity of curriculum-based measures to change in student performance. Curriculum-based measures were the number of correct word sequences (CWS) and correct minus incorrect word sequences (CIWS) written in expository essays. Criterion measures were the number of functional elements in and quality ratings of student essays. Results revealed a strong relationship between curriculum-based and criterion measures.

AB  - The authors investigate whether frequent in class exams can improve the performance of students in hybrid global business courses. An experiment was conducted in three hybrid sections of a global business course exposing students to short in class exams. The expectation of a short exam forces students to watch the online lectures and study the course material. By having more prepared students, the professor can devote class time to discussing international business issues. This results in significantly higher student performance. The performance of 182 students was examined and the results show significant improvements for all groups.

AB  - This study examined whether frequent testing would promote long-term retention of college-level course material. Students in a college course engaged in three different types of interval practice over the course of a 13-week semester: quizzes, quizzes with feedback, and study. We examined the impact of type of interval practice on performance on unit exams. Six exams were given that consisted of multiple choice (MC) questions presented during earlier practice, new highly related MC questions, and new highly related short answer (SA) questions. The variation in type of unit exam questions allowed for the examination of interval quiz-related transfer to related MC and related SA questions. Further, half of the unit exams were taken individually and half were taken collaboratively. This manipulation allowed us to examine post-collaborative facilitation. Results suggest that interval quizzing resulted in beneficial transfer effects to highly related MC and SA questions and post collaborative facilitation.

AB  - In partnership with Joint School District 2 in Meridian, Idaho, this theory-driven study assessed the impact of Keeping Learning on Track® (KLT™), a professional development program pioneered by Dylan Wiliam and his colleagues at the Educational Testing Service (ETS). A team of Northwest Evaluation Association™ (NWEA™) researchers surveyed teachers and students over two academic years (2012-13, 2013-14) to examine which elements of the program, and under what conditions, we saw the greatest impact on 1) the use of formative assessment instructional practices in the classroom and, 2) changes in student achievement measures in reading and mathematics. Our results were generally positive. The findings suggest that KLT influenced teacher practices and student engagement over time. Teacher and student survey responses report successful adoption of the five key formative assessment strategies. Additionally, participants reported positive evaluations of their KLT experience and cited sharing experiences with their peers in learning communities as the most helpful aspect of the program. There was little direct evidence that KLT impacted student achievement over the course of the study. But, as many researchers have observed, professional development programs may take more time to show discernible progress in terms of student achievement outcomes. Thus, it could be too early to see measurable gains in student achievement. NWEA plans to continue its partnership with Meridian and track student growth in subsequent years to explore this possibility. Lastly, various aspects of KLT implementation that were measured did not appear to influence our conclusions about KLT in Meridian. We hope our findings help Meridian and other partner districts assess the value of their investment in KLT and inform recommendations to improve the program and its delivery to improve student engagement and learning. The following are appended: (1) Tables and Figures; (2) Teacher, Teacher Leader, and Administrator Survey; and (3) Student Survey.

AB  - Mathematics assessment is often characterized in the literature as being composed of two broad components: Computation and Applications. Many assessment tools are available to evaluate student skill in these areas of mathematics. However, not all math tests can be used in formative evaluation to inform instruction and improve student achievement. Mathematics curriculum-based measurement (M-CBM) is one tool that has been developed for formative evaluation in mathematics. However, there is considerably less technical adequacy information on M-CBM than CBM reading. Of particular interest is the construct that M-CBM measures, computation or general mathematics achievement. This study utilized confirmatory factor analysis procedures to determine what constructs M-CBM actually measures in the context of a range of other mathematics measures. 207 4th graders were tested with math computation, math applications, and reading tests. Three theoretical models of mathematics were tested. Results indicated that a 2-factor model of mathematics where Computation and Applications were distinct although related constructs, M-CBM was a measure of Computation, and reading skill was highly correlated with both math factors best fit the data.

AB  - The validity and reliability of curriculum-based measures in reading as indicators of performance and progress for secondary-school students were examined. Thirty-five grade 8 students completed reading aloud and maze-selection measures weekly for 10 weeks. Criterion measures were the state standards test in reading and the Woodcock–Johnson III Test of Achievement. Different time frames for each measure were compared. Most alternate-form reliability coefficients were above .80. Criterion-related validity coefficients ranged from .77 to .89. No differences related to time were found. Only maze selection reflected significant growth, with an average increase of 1.29 correct choices per week. Maze growth was related to the reading performance level and to change on the Woodcock–Johnson III from pre- to posttest.

AB  - The effects on student achievement of goal size and data utilization rule and measurement frequency were evaluated with 20 special education teachers, each of whom selected 4 to 6 students (mean age 10.3 years) for participation. Teachers were assigned randomly to either a short term goal measurement or a long term goal measurement treatment. Teachers then randomly assigned each student to daily, weekly, or pre-post measurement, so that each teacher had one or two students in each measurement frequency cell. Students' oral reading rate was measured at weeks 1, 7, and 12 on random samples of isolated words comprised of kindergarten through third grade reading vocabulary. At week 12, students' oral reading rate was measured on third grade passages from basal texts. Analyses of variance revealed no treatment effect on any dependent measure. The findings contradicted previous research, and may be partly explained by poor implementation of the treatments. (Author)

AB  - Building domain knowledge is essential to a student's success in any course. Chemistry, similar to other STEM disciplines, has a strong cumulative element (i.e., topic areas continuously build upon prior coursework). We employed the testing effect, in the form of post-exam retrieval quizzes, as a way to improve students' understanding of chemistry over an entire semester. Students (n = 146) enrolled in Introduction to Chemistry were presented with retrieval quizzes released one week after each during-term exam (that covered that exam's content). We measured students' level of quiz participation, during-term exam scores (a control variable), and cumulative final exam scores to determine the effectiveness of implementing a post-exam retrieval quiz system. Most critically, students completing more than 50% of the retrieval quizzes performed significantly better (i.e., more than a half letter grade) on the cumulative final exam than those who were below 50% participation as determined by one-way between-subjects ANOVA and planned follow-up analyses. We found no significant differences between the participating groups on during-term exam scores, suggesting that high achieving students were not more likely than struggling students to participate in the practice testing (and thus benefit from it).

AB  - This study explored the effect of formative assessment on student achievement in science. Research in science education has shown that students enter science classrooms with previously formed explanatory models of the natural world; these naive 'mental models' have a substantial influence on their learning of scientific conceptions. In general, conceptual change describes the pathway from pre-instructional or prior conceptions to a post-instructional or desired conception. Conceptual change involves a fundamental restructuring of a network of concepts rather than fitting new concepts into an existing conceptual network or structure. Research has shown that conceptual change is difficult to promote; for example, students may accumulate multiple conceptions over the course of instruction, including both new misconceptions and more scientifically-sound conceptions. Helldén and Solomon (2004) found that although students tended to evoke the same, less-scientific conceptions over time, they could produce more scientifically-sound conceptions during interviews with appropriate prompting; thus, students undergo conceptual accumulation rather than conceptual change. Students can recall scientifically-sound conceptions they have learned and may use them to reason, but they do so in partnership or hybridization with their less-scientific prior conceptions. Formative assessment, which focuses on providing immediate feedback by acting upon student understanding during the course of instruction, and conceptual change have both been linked to increased student achievement. Formative assessment is an instructional strategy that helps teachers to assess students' current understanding, identify the gap between current understanding and expected understanding, and provide immediate and useful feedback to students on how to close the gap. Formative assessment ranges from formal (e.g. embedded, planned-for interactions between teacher and entire class) to informal (e.g. on-the-fly interactions between teacher and class or student). In this study, the links between formative assessment and conceptual accumulation and conceptual change were explored. Specifically, this study asked: (1) Does formative assessment promote conceptual accumulation, and (2) Does formative assessment promote conceptual change? It was hypothesized that conceptual change-focused formative assessment would foster conceptual change, in addition to supporting conceptual accumulation. It was further hypothesized that all students will show gains in conceptual accumulation as indicated by measures of declarative and procedural knowledge, but that students exposed to conceptual change-focused formative assessment would also show gains in conceptual change as indicated by measures of schematic knowledge or mental models. To research the effect of formative assessment on conceptual accumulation and conceptual change, a small randomized experiment involving 102 middle school students was conducted. In Phase I of the study, 52 6th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group; in Phase II of this study, 50 7th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Both the control and experimental groups in both phases were taught about sinking and floating by the same teacher (the author) with identical curriculum materials and activities. In addition, the experimental group received three sets of embedded formative assessments focused on conceptual change around the topic of why things sink and float during the course of instruction. In Phase I of this study, both groups were kept at the same pace through the entire sequence of investigations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the passage of the No Child Left Behind mandate, school systems clamored to ensure that all students showed academic growth. For schools with a high-achieving population, this could be a daunting task. This analysis examined the impact formative assessment had on student achievement in a high-achieving, middle school by measuring three variables. The researcher collected both quantitative and qualitative data to determine if significance existed between the control group and the treatment group. The sample was made up of 248 subjects. In addition, teacher attitude was also measured for insight. The findings of this study revealed mixed results. Some sub-populations within the sample showed significance, while others did not.

AB  - As part of the work from the Content Area Reading Project (CARP), which focuses on inservice teacher education in content area reading, a study examined the effects of an inservice content area reading program reflecting the CARP model on student reading and study skills achievement. The study also compared the uses of norm-referenced tests versus criterion-referenced tests in measuring reading and study skills achievement. Subjects were fourth, fifth, eighth, and ninth grade students of teachers who participated in the monthly inservice workshops on content area reading strategies (the experimental group) and of teachers who had not participated in the inservice project but who matched as closely as possible the project teachers (the comparison group). A measure of general reading ability, the Work-Study Skills subtest of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (norm-referenced), and selected subtests of the Wisconsin Tests of Reading Skills Development (criterion-referenced) were the instruments used in the study. No definite pattern of significant differences was established from class to class in the analysis of the data, a result that might be due to the lack of emphasis on reading and study skills in the inservice courses or to the urging of teachers in the program to be resource persons and to share ideas with colleagues (the comparison group teachers). The findings favored neither the norm-referenced tests nor the criterion-referenced tests, although the criterion-referenced test had more subtests to indicate specific areas of reading skill. (RL)

AB  - Due to the student-centered nature of problem-based learning (PBL) and project-based science (PBS), it is easy for teachers "not" to provide students with adequate feedback or enough support to promote critical thinking. However, research has shown that PBL and PBS are most effective when appropriate learning goals are defined, embedded supports and feedback are part of instruction, and there are multiple opportunities for self-assessment and revision (Barron et al. 1998). Instructional supports for student learning come in many forms. In this article, the authors describe how formative assessment can be used to support PBL and PBS to maximize student achievement.

AB  - The effective use of assessments is a key component of school improvement. This mixed-method study analyzed the effect of Discovery Education interim assessments on student performance in seven low-performing schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools over a two-year period. The third-grade reading End-of-Grade exam results of more than 1,000 students were compared to teacher and leader perception, use, and response to Discovery Education interim assessments during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. The results were mixed, indicating that in one year, the use of Discovery Education interim assessments resulted in improved student outcomes in reading, while, in the other year, student outcomes changed little. This study also outlines the practices and perceptions present in schools in which student outcomes were most greatly affected.

AB  - Internet technology has offered opportunities to develop ongoing assessment systems for classroom-based evaluation – on a daily basis. In this study, the researcher developed a web-based, curriculum-based measurement system with dynamic features which could generate different types of mathematics probes, track students' progress and provide diagnosed information as well as instructional suggestions for teachers. This paper explores the effects of the system on students' mathematical achievements. A total of 134 third-grade students (9- to 10-year-olds) in four classes participated. The teachers in all groups used the web-based curriculum-based measurement system with different types of curriculum-based measurement probes and growth modeling. The results indicated that the use of class-wide dynamic-growth modeling combined with mixed-type probes enabled the students to perform better than those using single-type probes. This outcome was not seen with the linear-growth modeling groups. The positive findings suggested that applying class-wide dynamic-growth modeling as well as the assessment of integrated mathematics competency in the instructional processes facilitated students' mathematics learning. Therefore, the web-based, curriculum-based measurement system was not only an assessment system, but also a tool for teachers to integrate instructional strategies based on curriculum-based measurement.

AB  - Curriculum-based assessment (CBA) represents a shift from use of standardized tests as quantifiers of student achievement toward traditional data-based instructional management. The role of assessment in educational programs is explored through presentation of three contrasting perspectives: assessment for placement versus assessment for instruction, education for the handicapped versus special education, and bureaucratic form versus educational reform. The CBA approach requires mechanisms for the collection of data and higher expectations of students. Instructional assistance involves motivating the student, teaching to mastery, and practicing until the skill becomes automatic. CBA can eliminate a large proportion of referrals to special education and expensive pull-out programs through use of more effective instructional strategies. The CBA concept rests on the finding that students learn better when taught at the "instructional" level, where a student already knows 93% to 97% of the material to be read or 70% to 85% of the material to be practiced in drill. An example of applying CBA to reading instruction presents techniques for word recognition, fluency, and comprehension. The appendix contains descriptions of schools that have implemented CBA. (JDD)

AB  - Two experiments are reported that compared incentive motivation for studying, based on a weekly quiz in a course, to a metacognitive strategy for studying, based on identifying key terms, and providing definitions and elaborations as homework. In the first experiment, with a sample of 109 students enrolled in an educational psychology class, the study spanned a five-week period, and a control group was also included. On the achievement test at the end of the time period, students having the test as an incentive outscored the homework group by over 10 points and the control group by over 15. In the second experiment, with a sample of 117 students from the same populations, enrolled in the same course, the study spanned a 15-week period, and students were subdivided for statistical purposes into high, medium, and low groups on prior grade point average (GPA). The results showed that the advantages of the test incentive condition over three achievement tests accrued primarily to students of low GPA. The results were interpreted to indicate that college students may already have acquired metacognitive strategies suitable for studying text, but are less likely to use them unless sufficiently motivated. Two figures and two tables present study data. (Author)

AB  - Despite calls for reform, little has changed in how teachers teach or test over the past few decades. Teacher-made assessments, in particular, have been underutilized for reforming classroom practice. Yet research has shown that staff development that emphasizes teacher collaboration around formative assessment can be effective in changing teaching practices and improving student learning. This study implemented and evaluated a pilot effort for middle school mathematics teachers along these lines called Formative Assessment with Collaborative Teaming and Support (FACTS). The research focused on whether FACTS led to improved student achievement and whether it changed teacher beliefs and practices. Eleven middle school math teachers volunteered to participate, eight using the FACTS intervention and three acting as an outside control group. The study included 31 classroom sections and 843 students. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used in the analysis. Benchmark tests were given to students three times during the first trimester of a school year. Gain scores, covariance analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling were used to measure treatment effects. Second, participating teachers were surveyed at the beginning and end of the intervention to measure changes in their beliefs and practices. Survey results were compared to national outcomes on similar questions, and treatment groups and individual teachers were compared in terms of pre- to post-intervention changes. Finally, qualitative data gathered during collaboration meetings was combined with post-intervention interviews to help verify results and add context to the study. Overall, the findings for the use of the FACTS intervention were mixed. There was no significant difference in student achievement growth across the treatment groups, indicating that FACTS did not significantly impact student learning. Yet changes in teacher beliefs and practices were found, as indicated by positive effect sizes on measures of assessment beliefs and practices, instructional beliefs, instructional practices, data use and teacher-to-teacher interaction. Limitations of this study, including the short intervention time frame and decentralized curriculum implementation schedules, may have contributed to the mixed results.

AB  - Although past research indicates that giving brief quizzes, administered either regularly or randomly, may lead to improvement in students' performance on major exams, negligible research has targeted daily writing activities that require the processing of course information at a deeper level than might result from simply reading course materials and answering factual questions about those materials. The treatment strategy in the current study involved the administration of brief daily writing activities based on critical concepts previously announced for discussion in class. The targeted daily writing activities were designed to encourage students to think critically about pairs of concepts embedded in the instructor notes available to them. Requiring more complex learning approaches in preparing for the daily writing activities was expected to promote student use of similar approaches on course exams. Although students constructed written products at the beginning of five class sessions in each of the five units of the course, only one of these products was randomly selected for grading per unit. Thus, the study attempted to determine if an arrangement that required students to engage in daily writing tasks could meet the criteria for both effectiveness (improve deep thinking on multiple-choice exams) and efficiency (not require an inordinate amount of instructor time in and out of class). The overall research question in the current study was whether frequent and high-quality engagement in the writing activities helped students prepare for major exams different in format (multiple choice) from the writing activities. The predictive potential of the daily writing activities was compared to that of other known predictors of exam performance in the target course (e.g., critical thinking, generic vocabulary, and attendance), all of which have previously correlated with exam performance at a moderate level. The study addressed the following primary questions regarding the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the daily writing activities: (1) Did engaging in daily writing activities improve student performance on targeted multiple-choice exam items (items related to concepts addressed in the writing activities)?; (2) How well did the frequency versus the quality of students' daily writing predict performance on targeted exam items?; and (3) How well did student performance on the writing activities, compared with other established exam performance predictors, predict performance on targeted exam items? Compared with other established predictors of exam performance, scores on the writing activities proved to be the strongest predictor. (Contains 7 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - In this action research case study, the researchers used a multiple baseline across two student pairs design to investigate the effects of the error self-correction method on the spelling accuracy behaviors for four fifth-grade students who were identified as being at risk for learning disabilities. The dependent variable was the participants' spelling skills, which were measured using weekly spelling tests. The study took place in an integrated co-taught classroom, over a 15-week period with one spelling test per week. The results indicated that error self-correction was an effective intervention to improve the spelling accuracy behaviors of students at risk for learning disabilities. The participants' mean weekly spelling test scores improved at least 24% over baseline levels during the intervention phase. A discussion of the results and suggestions for implementation are included.

AB  - Since the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (2001), districts, schools, and educators are pressured to collect, analyze and report data annually regarding student performance. If high-stakes assessments are to be useful tools for educators in their classrooms, the data need to be applicable in conveying meaningful instructional information that supports not only school-wide but also individual student improvement. The identification of student difficulty depends on valid assessment measures and effective educators who are competent of recognizing the value of using data to drive instructional decisions. In-class professional development opportunities made available through literacy coaches can provide teachers with assistance in understanding the significance of using assessments to support literacy instruction. This study emphasizes the role of schools in utilizing data and ongoing classroom-based professional development to drive instruction that enables kindergartners to make progress in literacy. The objective of this study is to determine the measurable effects in literacy as a result of systematic and explicit data-driven instruction derived from classroom-based assessments and collaborative teaching among kindergarten learners. To assess the levels of student achievement, the study utilizes a mixed-method design to clarify and illustrate both quantitative and qualitative information. Quantitative evidence of student achievement is demonstrated through phonemic awareness assessment data presented through ANOVA and SPSS comparisons. Additionally, qualitative research investigates classroom teachers' perceptions regarding coaching and collaboration. Interview results are presented to identify specific outcomes of the year-long study. The development of the teachers' professional experience and collaboration, as well as their understanding of assessment and data-based instructional decisions are described. Findings for this study indicate that student achievement scores were improved as a result of data-driven instructional decisions derived from a combination of formative and summative assessments. Additional effects in early literacy progress were demonstrated through classroom teachers working collaboratively with a literacy coach to assist in the process of professional learning, according to the results of this study. Recommendations focus on the importance of promoting professional development opportunities for classroom teachers. Assessments to support instructional decisions and effective early literacy instruction necessitate continuous learning experiences on behalf of both educators and students alike.

AB  - Large classroom population in Korean schools has necessitated the development of an educational model which (1) is effective with a large heterogeneous group of students; (2) does not require an overload on classroom teachers; (3) does not presuppose massive teacher retraining; and (4) is adaptable to a wide range of existing school situations. An instructional model, the Mastery Learning Project, was devised with the following components: (1) diagnosis of learning deficiencies; (2) compensatory programs; (3) presentation of learning objectives; (4) teacher instruction with emphasis on charts and audiovisual materials; (5) formative tests; (6) remedial programs for those failing in mastery; (7) enrichment programs for those attaining mastery; (8) cooperative learning activities; and (9) summative tests. Two studies involving respectively 272 seventh-grade students (half control, half experimental) showed a high rate of success for the experimental groups. Evaluation techniques were employed at a number of points in the educational process: a diagnostic test at the beginning of the unit, formative tests at the midpoint, summative tests upon unit completion, and tests for "serendipity effects" (such as problem solving ability, creativity, critical thinking, and other outcomes not specified as learning objectives). The project has now been extended to 630 schools at the seventh-eighth-and ninth-grade levels. (An evaluation of the project by the Director, Department of Planning and Financing of Education, UNESCO, is appended.) (MB)

AB  - In this report, we describe the results of a rigorous two-year study of the impacts of a mathematics initiative called Ongoing Assessment Project (OGAP) on teacher and student learning in grades 3-5 in two Philadelphia area school districts. OGAP is a mathematics program which combines teacher formative assessment practices with knowledge of student developmental progressions to build deeper student understanding of mathematics content. OGAP includes teacher professional development, classroom resources, school-based routines for regular practice, and ongoing school-based supports. The study was conducted in 61 schools during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years, with OGAP randomly assigned to 31 schools and the remaining 30 serving as comparison sites. The results of this study showed that OGAP produced meaningful impacts on both teacher knowledge and student learning.

AB  - This study explored how the implementation of formative assessment with the use of rubrics in high school English classes in Tokyo, Japan, improved students' motivation and encouraged ownership of learning. The researcher implemented rubrics as a formative assessment strategy in her two English writing classes over two terms with her co-inquirer/team-teaching partner and reflected on student responses and her own teaching practice. The study was carried out using professional inquiry informed by action research, based on the cycle of actions and reflection developed by Brown and Cherkowski (2011). As a theoretical framework, learning community theory identified this inquiry as an act of leadership, one that began to build interpersonal and organizational capacity in a school by sharing personal learning. Findings focused on student responses, teacher learning, and the school-level organizational response.

AB  - Mathematics education aims to help students understand and solve problems in their daily lives. Facilitating mathematical problem-solving for most students is a major challenge for teachers and students. The research was carried out to support students in developing their ability to resolve problems by learning the first-degree equations in one unknown. This experimental study was conducted on a random sample of 82 eighth-grade students at An Thoi junior high school in Can Tho City, Vietnam. This sample of 82 students was divided equally in experimental group and control group with 41 participants each. The tools used were real-world problems associated with the first-degree equations in one unknown. During the experiment, data were collected through study sheets, pre-test and post-test, and student interviews. Quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were applied to evaluate the results obtained and verify research hypotheses. Research results showed that most experimental group students showed improvement in the manifestation of problem-solving ability. Furthermore, it was observed that the problem-solving activities positively impacted students' positivity, initiative, creativity, and confidence in learning. It is recommended to provide more opportunities to students for practicing problems of the first-degree equations in one unknown, showing them how to discover, pose and solve problems encountered in learning in the lives of individuals, families and communities.

AB  - This study examined effects of a repeated reading intervention, Quick Reads, with incidental word-level scaffolding instruction. Second- and third-grade students with passage-reading fluency performance between the 10th and 60th percentiles were randomly assigned to dyads, which were in turn randomly assigned to treatment (paired tutoring, n = 82) or control (no tutoring, n = 80) conditions. Paraeducators tutored dyads for 30 min per day, 4 days per week, for 15 weeks (November-March). At midintervention, most teachers with students in the study were formally observed during their literacy blocks. Multilevel modeling was used to test for direct treatment effects on pretest-posttest gains as well as to test for unique treatment effects after classroom oral text reading time, 2 pretests, and corresponding interactions were accounted for. Model results revealed both direct and unique treatment effects on gains in word reading and fluency. Moreover, complex interactions between group, oral text reading time, and pretests were also detected, suggesting that pretest skills should be taken into account when considering repeated reading instruction for 2nd and 3rd graders with low to average passage-reading fluency.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of criteria-referenced formative assessment on music achievement. Archival data from 1,173 students who participated in the first two years of the Arts Achieve project were used to examine the overall and school level effects of criteria-referenced formative assessment on music achievement, as well as its effect on content knowledge, listening, and performance achievement tasks. The relationships between sources of feedback from formative assessment – self, peer, teacher – and music achievement were also investigated. Unbiased causal treatment effects were derived after employing propensity score analysis to minimize selection bias and adjust for pre-treatment differences. The results of this study indicate that criteria-referenced formative assessment had a small, positive overall effect on music achievement, with the largest gains in achievement at the elementary school level. Criteria-referenced formative assessment had the largest effect on content knowledge and listening tasks; however, the effects on music performance were mixed and therefore inconclusive. Feedback from teacher assessment and self-assessment alone were positively and significantly related to music achievement. Peer assessment, however, was not a significant predictor of music achievement. This study contributes to scholarship on formative assessment by providing a framework for using propensity score analysis to investigate constructs in formative assessment research. In addition, this study provides music educators with empirical evidence of the efficacy of using criteria-referenced formative assessment practices to promote and support music teaching and learning.

AB  - Classroom formative assessment (CFA) is considered to be a fundamental part of effective teaching, as it is presumed to enhance student performance. However, there is only limited empirical evidence to support this notion. In this effect study, a quasi-experiment was conducted to compare 2 conditions. In the treatment condition, 17 teachers implemented a CFA model containing both daily and weekly goal-directed instruction, assessment, and immediate instructional feedback for students who needed additional support. In the control condition, 17 teachers implemented a modification to their usual practice. They assessed their students’ mastery of learning goals on the basis of half-yearly mathematics tests, and prepared weekly pre-teaching sessions for groups of low-achieving students. The posttests showed no significant differences in student performance between the 2 conditions after controlling for student and teacher characteristics. The degree of implementation of the CFA model, however, appeared to be positively related to the 5th-grade students’ performance.

AB  - Supporting students with difficulties in learning mathematics is a challenge for teachers and educational administrators. Formative assessment is considered to play a successful role in supporting at-risk students as well as students without difficulties in mathematics. There is a need for intervention programs, including formative assessment techniques, that (a) are easy to implement in the regular classroom without requiring radical changes in teachers' individual teaching style, and (b) are effective in supporting at-risk students at the earliest stage possible in their school careers. This article analyzes an effectiveness trial of a formative assessment program developed to meet these goals and conducted in the first two years of elementary school. The examination of the longitudinal dataset from Grades 1-3 (N = 2,330) revealed an effect after the implementation, which was maintained at nearly the same effect size one year after completion of the program. The findings imply that formative assessment can foster the arithmetic achievement of students at risk as well as that of the entire class without changing the curriculum or teachers' individual teaching style.

AB  - Six curriculum-based measures of math performance were developed for use with 4-year old preschool children. Measures included counting objects, selecting numbers, naming numbers, selecting shapes, counting, and visual discrimination. Technical properties of probe scores were assessed in two rural public preschool programs. Alternate forms, source, and item reliability of probe scores were assessed with approximately 50 children per probe. A randomly-selected sample of 53 children participated in the validation phase of the study. Concurrent validity of probe scores was assessed with the Brigance Screens and the Test of Early Mathematics Ability. Four of the probes yielded reliable and meaningful estimates of early math skills. Additional research is needed to evaluate the degree to which the probes are sensitive to growth and useful within comprehensive curriculum-based assessment models.

AB  - The 'testing effect' refers to the finding that after an initial study opportunity, testing is more effective for long-term retention than restudying. The testing effect seems robust and is a finding from the field of cognitive science that has important implications for education. However, it is unclear whether this effect also applies to the acquisition of problem-solving skills, which is important to establish given the key role problem solving plays in, for instance, math and science education. Worked examples are an effective and efficient way of acquiring problem-solving skills. Forty students either only studied worked examples (SSSS) or engaged in testing after studying an example by solving an isomorphic problem (STST). Surprisingly, results showed equal performance in both conditions on an immediate retention test after 5 min, but the SSSS condition outperformed the STST condition on a delayed retention test after 1 week. These findings suggest the testing effect might not apply to acquiring problem-solving skills from worked examples.

AB  - Schools and governments are increasingly investing in adaptive practice software. To date, the evidence whether adaptivity improves learning outcomes is limited and mixed. A large-scale randomized control trial is conducted in Dutch secondary schools to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive practice program relative to a static program. Learning theories predict that adaptive practicing is more effective, but this experimental evaluation provides a more nuanced picture. Relative to the static software environment, students working in the adaptive software environment receive more difficult exercises, practice longer and answer fewer questions correctly. Takeup and usage of the software program is, overall, modest, but varies considerably within and between classrooms. The outcome differences between both environments are more pronounced in classrooms with higher practice intensity. On average, no test score effects are found, but static practicing does improve test scores for higher ability students (0.08 σ ). Caution is thus warranted when adaptive practice software is implemented to address individual learning needs, as static formative test preparation can be more effective in improving test scores.

AB  - Educators use curriculum-based measurement of oral reading (CBM-R) to measure student response to instruction. Current decision-making frameworks assume students demonstrate linear growth across a school year. However, growth appears nonlinear for at least a subgroup of students. We assessed the degree to which grade two ( n = 800) and grade three ( n = 800) students receiving intensive interventions experienced discontinuous growth. We also explored when discontinuous growth tended to occur, and whether students improved or regressed afterward. Results indicate linear patterns were adequate for most students (80 percent). Students who showed discontinuous growth early tended to improve afterward. Conversely, students who showed discontinuous growth later tended to plateau. Findings suggest multilevel models may obscure variability in growth patterns. Practice and research implications are discussed.

AB  - Computer adaptive tests (CATs) hold promise to monitor student progress within multitiered systems of support. However, the relationship between how long and how often data are collected and the technical adequacy of growth estimates from CATs has not been explored. Given CAT administration times, it is important to identify optimal data collection schedules to minimize missed instructional time. We used simulation methodology to investigate how the duration and frequency of data collection influenced the reliability, validity, and precision of growth estimates from a math CAT. A progress monitoring dataset of 746 Grade 4, 664 Grade 5, and 400 Grade 6 students from 40 schools in the upper Midwest was used to generate model parameters. Across grades, 53% of students were female and 53% were White. Grade level was not as influential as the duration and frequency of data collection on the technical adequacy of growth estimates. Low-stakes decisions were possible after 14-18 weeks when data were collected weekly (420-540 min of assessment), 20-24 weeks when collected every other week (300-360 min of assessment), and 20-28 weeks (150-210 min of assessment) when data were collected once a month, depending on student grade level. The validity and precision of growth estimates improved when the duration and frequency of progress monitoring increased. Given the amount of time required to obtain technically adequate growth estimates in the present study, results highlight the importance of weighing the potential costs of missed instructional time relative to other types of assessments, such as curriculum-based measures. Implications for practice, research, as well as future directions are also discussed.

AB  - No Child Left Behind mandates accountability data for school districts. This mandate has led to increased attention to instruction and academic remediation among educational researchers. The current study used schoolwide curriculum-based assessment (CBA) and curriculum-based measurement (CBM) data to plan and deliver mathematics instruction to examine if this would lead to improved student skill within one school year and improved group test scores between school years. The Screening to Enhance Equitable Educational Placement (STEEP) schoolwide problem-solving model was used in one elementary building, with CBM data used to track progress and CBA data used daily to track mastery at each skill level. Results suggested that children made significant progress within one school year, as measured by CBM, and the school significantly increased Stanford-9 mathematics scores after implementing the program. Potential implications for assessment and instructional practice are included. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Brief experimental analysis (BEA) can be used to specify intervention characteristics that produce positive learning gains for individual students. A key challenge to the use of BEA for intervention planning is the identification of performance indicators (including topography of the skill, measurement characteristics, and decision criteria) that meaningfully relate to longer term success in the learning environment. This study investigates the utility of various curriculum-based assessment and measurement estimates of mathematics performance for predicting functional outcomes (i.e., retention of learned skills over time and faster learning of related content in the future). All children in grades 2-5 at the participating school participated in protocol-based computational fluency-building intervention 4 days per week for an entire school year. Specific criteria were applied each week to systematically increase intervention difficulty classwide according to a pre-established sequence of computational skill objectives. Three measurements were routinely obtained. Each week children completed a timed probe of the skill for which intervention was currently occurring and a timed probe of previously mastered skills from the sequence of computational skill objectives. Each month, all children completed a timed probe of mathematics skills representing computational skills that students were expected to master by year's end at each grade level. At all grade levels, learning a skill that appeared early in the hierarchy or sequence of skills related positively to learning of future related and more complex computational skills. Fluency criteria were specified that predicted retention of the skill over several months.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness that transitional activities have on student achievement and attendance when students moved from elementary school to middle school. The data were gathered from two school districts that are demographically similar. Data included average daily attendance rates, Terra Nova Achievement Scores from social studies in grades five, six, and seven, as well as math in grades five, six, and seven. There were 187 students in the Treatment Group and 147 in the Control Group for a total of 334 students. Comparison of means for demographic equivalency of the groups (t-test) and a MANCOVA with repeated measures analysis of seventh grade Math and Social Studies test scores were run. The results indicated no significant differences in rates of attendance from students transitioning from elementary to middle school whether they have experienced transitional activities or not. In addition, there were no significant differences in Terra Nova Social Studies or Math Achievement Test scores between students transitioning from elementary to middle school whether they have experienced a comprehensive transition program or not (F = .003, p = .960 for seventh grade Math, F = .947, p = .331 for seventh grade Social Studies). There was a drop in both attendance and achievement test scores for both the control and treatment groups. While this study determined there is no reason to believe the interventions made any difference in the overall attendance and achievement test scores, the literature and other studies have shown positive results. Programs of this sort need further study and analysis to gather additional data on transitional activities and their effectiveness on students entering middle school.

AB  - Addressing the literacy needs of secondary school students involves efforts to raise the achievement levels of all students and to address specifically the needs of struggling readers. One approach to this problem is to consider the application of a Response to Intervention (RTI) model with older students. We describe an approach to enhanced literacy instruction for middle school students that includes the essential components of any RTI model: universal screening, progress monitoring, and multi-tiered instructional service delivery. We use screening and progress-monitoring tools specifically tied to state accountability tests and a multi-tiered instructional framework that addresses the literacy needs of all middle school students, including struggling readers. Presently a large-scale, multi-site randomized trial is under way to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this RTI model for middle school students. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The authors report the effects of a yearlong, very small-group, intensive reading intervention for eighth-grade students with serious reading difficulties who had demonstrated low response to intervention (RTI) in both Grades 6 and 7. At the beginning of Grade 6, a cohort of students identified as having reading difficulties were randomized to treatment or comparison conditions. Treatment group students received researcher-provided reading intervention in Grade 6, which continued in Grade 7 for those with low response to intervention; comparison students received no researcher-provided intervention. Participants in the Grade 8 study were members of the original treatment (N = 28) and comparison (N = 13) conditions who had failed to pass a state-mandated reading comprehension test in both Grades 6 and 7. In Grade 8, treatment group students received a 50-minute, daily, individualized, intensive reading intervention in groups of two to four students per teacher. The results showed that students in the treatment condition demonstrated significantly higher scores than comparison students on standardized measures of comprehension (effect size = 1.20) and word identification (effect size = 0.49), although most continued to lack grade-level proficiency in reading despite 3 years of intervention. Findings from this study provide a rationale for intensive intervention for middle school students with severe reading difficulties. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This study examined the effects of Reading Intervention for Adolescents, a 2-year extensive reading intervention targeting current and former English learners identified as struggling readers based on their performance on the state accountability assessment. Students who enrolled at three participating urban high schools were randomly assigned to the Reading Intervention for Adolescents treatment condition (n = 175) or a business-as-usual comparison condition. Students assigned to the treatment condition participated in the intervention for approximately 50 min daily for 2 school years in lieu of a school-provided elective course, which business-as-usual students took consistent with typical scheduling. Findings revealed significant effects for the treatment condition on sentence-level fluency and comprehension (g = 0.18) and on a proximal measure of vocabulary learning (g = 0.41), but not on standardized measures of word reading, vocabulary, or reading comprehension (g range: -0.09 to 0.06). Post hoc moderation analyses investigated whether initial proficiency levels interacted with treatment effects. On sentence-level fluency and comprehension and on vocabulary learning, initial scores were significantly associated with treatment effects--however, in opposite directions. Students who scored low at baseline on sentence reading and comprehension scored relatively higher at posttest on that measure, whereas students who scored high at baseline on the proximal vocabulary measure scored relatively higher at posttest on that measure. The discussion focuses on the difficulty of remediating persistent reading difficulties in high school, particularly among English learners, who are often still in the process of acquiring academic proficiency in English.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) on the reading skills of urban middle-school students using novels as the curriculum. Teacher-led instruction was compared with CWPT and CWPT plus a lottery contingency for appropriate on-task and tutoring behaviors. Three sixth-grade general education reading classes under the direction of one teacher participated. Data were collected on all students from weekly written tests of vocabulary and comprehension. In addition, oral reading rate and academic engagement data were collected from three 'low-achieving' target students. Procedural fidelity and consumer satisfaction were also assessed. Overall, results demonstrated improved performance on weekly tests when CWPT was implemented compared with teacher-led instruction. Further improvement in students' test performance resulted when CWPT plus lottery was implemented. Data also revealed differences in the types of academic responses made during teacher-led instruction and CWPT and increases in oral reading rates for two target students. These findings suggest that CWPT, particularly CWPT plus lottery, can improve the reading skills of urban middle school students. Further research is needed to confirm these results.

AB  - Children at risk for early reading difficulties were identified on entry into kindergarten, and half of these children received small-group intervention two to three times a week during their kindergarten year. The other half received whatever remedial assistance was offered by their home schools. These children were again assessed at the beginning of first grade, and those who continued to have difficulties in reading received either one-to-one daily tutoring offered by project teachers from the beginning to the end of first grade or whatever remedial assistance was offered by their home schools over the same time period. All target children were periodically assessed through the end of third grade. Results suggest that either kindergarten intervention alone or kindergarten intervention combined with first-grade intervention are both useful vehicles for preventing early and long-term reading difficulties in most at-risk children.

AB  - An interim study was conducted in Kentucky to determine the effectiveness of Competency Based Vocational Education (CBVE) and to compare its effectiveness to that of traditional teaching methodologies. Research surveys of those directly involved in the implementation of CBVE were used to ascertain if CBVE is meeting its self-stated goals. Approximately twenty-five percent of all high school and postsecondary educators and students (forty-five administrators, fifty-five teachers, and 745 students) participating in CBVE in Kentucky were questioned. Five aspects of the program were evaluated: instructional planning, student impact, instructional management, professional development, and programmatic aspects. To compare the effectiveness of CBVE and traditional methodologies, a cognitive skill test and classroom summary report (which incorporated a performance skill test) were administered to eleven classes in the areas of bank teller, secretary, and tractor mechanics. Based on the test scores and questionnaire responses, the following conclusions were reached: (1) CBVE was meeting the career needs of students, (2) CBVE students were progressing faster than students taught by traditional methods and learned a larger amount of subject matter, and (3) CBVE was inexpensive to implement in the schools' present facilities. Because these conclusions resulted from an interim, and therefore limited, study, they should be viewed within that context. (ELG)

AB  - Although the effectiveness of student response systems in improving student learning is inconclusive, clickers can be used to create a positive learning environment in the classroom, which can help increase student achievement. With the use of clickers, students showed modest improvements in their performance in conceptual summative assessments. Clickers created a learning environment where all students could participate and be engaged. Students reported that the clickers helped them improve their learning. The clickers allowed for instant feedback and a means to assess student knowledge without penalty. These formative assessments had a positive impact on student beliefs and allowed the teacher to reflect on instructional strategies. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - The aim of this action research project was to improve student learning by encouraging more "time on task" and to improve self-assessment and feedback through the introduction of weekly online tests in a Year 2 lecture module in biological sciences. Initially voluntary online tests were offered to students and those who participated achieved higher exam marks than those who did not, but completion rate was low. Making the tests compulsory led to high completion rates, but class performance decreased, indicating that using the same assessment for formative and for summative purposes is not always beneficial for learning. Finally, these problems were resolved by introducing a two-stage approach: the first stage of each test was formative and provided prompt feedback. However, students had to achieve 80% to progress to the second summative stage of the test. The two-stage online tests led to significantly improved class performance. This novel test design ensures that students go through at least two attempts and therefore fully benefit from the learning opportunities presented by the formative stage. Two-stage online tests present the opportunity to provide regular feedback in large classes and to improve performance not only of good but also of "weak" students. (Contains 7 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - Context-based science courses stimulate students to reconstruct the information presented by connecting to their prior knowledge and experiences. However, students need support. Formative assessments inform both teacher and students about students’ knowledge deficiencies and misconceptions and how students can be supported. Research on formative assessments suggests a positive impact on students’ science achievement, although its success depends on how the formative assessment is implemented in class. The aim of this study was to provide insights into the effects of formative assessments on achievement during a context-based chemistry course on lactic acid. In a classroom action research setting, a pre-test/post-test control group design with switching replications was applied. Student achievement was measured in two pre-tests, two post-tests and a retention test. Participants were Grade 9 students from one secondary school in the Netherlands. Repeated-measures analysis showed a significant effect of formative assessments on students’ achievement. During the implementation of the formative assessments, intriguing discussions emerged between students, between students and teacher, and between teachers. Adding formative assessments to context-based approaches reinforces their strength to meet with the current challenges of chemistry education. Formative assessments affect students’ achievement positively and stimulate feedback between students and teacher(s).

AB  - Given the high proportion of struggling readers in school and the long-term negative consequences of underachievement for those affected, the question of prevention options arises. The early identification of central indicators for reading literacy is a noteworthy starting point. In this context, curriculum-based measurements have established themselves as reliable and valid instruments for monitoring the progress of learning processes. This article is dedicated to the assessment of word recognition in silent reading as an indicator of adequate reading fluency. The process of developing an item pool is described, from which instruments for learning process diagnostics can be derived. A sample of 4268 students from grades 1-4 processed a subset of items. Each student template included anchor items, which all students processed. Using Item Response Theory, item statistics were estimated for the entire sample and all items. After eliminating unsuitable items (N = 206), a one-dimensional, homogeneous pool of items remained. In addition, there are high correlations with another established reading test. This provides the first evidence that the recording of word recognition skills for silent reading can be seen as an economic indicator for reading skills. Although the item pool forms an important basis for the extraction of curriculum-based measurements, further investigations to assess the diagnostic suitability (e.g., the measurement invariance over different test times) are still pending.

AB  - This research was a field-based investigation into the impact of written feedback on students' perceptions, motivation, and academic performance. Seventy-nine fourth grade students, from five elementary classrooms participated in two studies. Study 1 (n = 15) was an ABAB-type, reversal design, intended to provide support for a cause-and-effect relationship between feedback scores (i.e., a rubric-based evaluation of teacher's written feedback) and feedback effectiveness (i.e., a survey-based measure of students' views on the value of written feedback). Study 2 (n = 64) was a quasi-experimental study intended to demonstrate: (a) the relationship between feedback scores and feedback effectiveness, (b) an association between feedback effectiveness and academic motivation, (c) an association between feedback effectiveness and academic performance, and (d) a curvilinear relationship between assignment grade and feedback scores. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) confirmed that the experimental group reported a significantly higher level of Learning Goal Orientation, one aspect of academic motivation (p < .05). A General Linear Model Repeated Measures procedure found support for relationships between feedback scores and feedback effectiveness, and between assignment grade and feedback scores. The research was unable to demonstrate a relationship between feedback effectiveness and academic performance. The potential motivational and educational benefits of enhanced written feedback are discussed, and recommendations for implementation are offered.

AB  - Two separate studies were conducted: 1) one examining the effect on sixth grade subjects (N=113) of relevant questions occurring shortly after reading textual material on posttraining tests to a control condition not receiving the questions, and 2) one replicating it and also examining learning in small group (individual-like situations) as well as intact classrooms, and comparing the performance of sixth graders (N=96) and college students (N=74) on the same content. Data for the first study consisted of the number of correct responses by each student to the three daily 12-question posttests and the 18-question post-posttest; for the second study the number of correct responses by Ss to a 16-item posttest and a 20-item post-posttest. Results were submitted to means tests and analysis of variance to determine the effects on performance of class, day, conditions, type of administration, and their possible interactions. The study failed to support previous studies: There was no general facilitative effect of interspersed questions (after relevant text material) on incidental learning. No experimental differences were found when sixth graders were treated in intact classroom situations vs. small groups, and no differences were found that could be attributed to days with respect to short term and delayed retention. If "mathemagenic behaviors" are generated in children, they do not seem to take the same form as those reported in young adults. (JS)

AB  - In the present study, the impact of formative assessment on secondary school students' mathematics achievement and their metacognitive awareness was examined. The participants included 164 (84 boys) grade 11 students and four mathematics teachers from four secondary schools in Kenya. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest non-equivalent group design was used to determine if there was any significant difference in the students' mathematics achievement scores and their metacognitive awareness after a formative assessment intervention. The influence of gender on mathematics achievement and metacognitive awareness was also examined. Formative assessment was conceptualized as an instructional approach consisting of five strategies. After controlling for pretest scores, the results revealed that students who were taught using formative assessment instructional approach outperformed those taught using conventional approach for both mathematics achievement (p = 0.014, n[superscript 2] = 0.38) and metacognitive awareness (p < 0.001, n[superscript 2] = 0.47). Analysis based on gender did not reveal any gender influence on students' mathematics achievement (p = 0.571, n[superscript 2] = 0.002) and their metacognitive awareness (p = 0.287, n[superscript 2] = 0.008). The current study adds knowledge to the limited empirical evidence regarding the impact of formative assessment conceptualized as an instructional approach on students' mathematic's achievement and their metacognitive awareness.

AB  - The research study examined whether a difference existed between the reading achievement scores of an experimental group and a control group in standardized reading achievement. This difference measured the effect of systematic oral reading fluency instruction with repeated readings. Data from the 4Sight Pennsylvania Benchmark Reading Assessments and the DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency Benchmark measured reading achievement outcomes of fourth and fifth grade students at two Pennsylvania elementary schools using a pre-test and a post-test measure. Paired and independent t-test analyses examined differences in outcomes within and between each group at the p=.05 level of significance. Statistically significant differences on both measures were found within the experimental and control groups.

AB  - This study considered how the timing of assessments affects summer learning loss estimates and the evaluation of interventions designed to reduce summer learning loss. By utilizing an efficient assessment called reading curriculum-based measurement (R-CBM), measurements of seasonal learning were calculated with a minimized school influence schedule that compressed out as much school time from the summer vacation period as possible to compare with a more traditional schedule. Measuring based on the minimized school influence schedule resulted in summer learning loss of 17.370 words per minute compared to learning loss 5.564 words per minute. Based on these measurements, summer learning loss was underestimated by 219%. The study also revealed that controlling for testing interval by including the testing dates does not completely account for this underestimation because the learning growth rate at the end of the year is significantly greater than the rest of the school year. The growth rate at the beginning of the year was not significantly different than the rest of the year but this may be because of the tendency of teachers to focus on relationship building and classroom management at the beginning of the year. Follow-up interviews with teacher showed the increased growth rate at the end of the year possibly occur because teachers meaningfully change instruction to maintain the attention of their students as the school year end approaches. This study also considered if the patterns in the data support the findings of previous research of a compensatory effect of schools. The results show children on free/reduced lunch learn at a slower rate than children not on free/reduced lunch during the school year, but then the growth rates are similar during the summer. The effectiveness of Summer Boost, a learning loss intervention, were also considered. While utilizing the minimized school influence model improved the outlook for Summer Boost, the resulting gains were not statistically significant. However, this result may be because of a small sample size (the treatment group included 68 students) rather than the quality of the program.

AB  - It is the moral responsibility of educators to work diligently to provide every student with rich, challenging coursework in efforts to prepare them for post high school careers and education. The use of common formative assessments provides teachers with the valuable, timely information they need to make instructional decisions that will better support the learning of all students. The purpose of this study was to determine staff members' perceptions of the implementation and effective use of common formative assessments in a progressive upper elementary school in the Midwestern United States. This study also sought to discover the types of leadership that facilitate the effective use of common formative assessments, and explored the cultural ideals and beliefs that contribute to the effective us of these assessments. The conceptual underpinnings of this study included social justice advocacy leadership, a culture that fosters growth and achievement for all learners, and assessment that supports every child. Research questions were developed to ascertain the effective practices this school used to implement common formative assessment that contributed to sustained achievement in mathematics. This study also sought to to discover the types of leadership and cultural characteristics that contributed to the effective use of these assessments. This instrumental, qualitative case study analyzed the perceptions of third, fourth, and fifth grade level teachers through six focus group discussions. In addition three leadership interviews were conducted that involved the building principal, instructional coach, and school counselor. An open-ended survey gleaned additional insights from the instructional staff at this progressive upper elementary school. Several documents pertinent to the study were analyzed. Evidence indicated the implementation of common formative assessments in this school did contribute to sustained mathematics achievement. Three major themes emerged: (a) focus and alignment of curriculum, instruction, and assessments, (b) using data to drive instruction, and (c) differentiating instruction to meet student learning needs. Four predominant types of leadership facilitated the implementation and effective use of common formative assessments (a) renewal leadership, (b) moral/ethical leadership, (c) instructional leadership, and (d) distributed leadership. Cultural characteristics that emerged as having significant contributions included: (a) reculture, (b) collaboration, (3) high expectations, and (d) caring relationships. Implications for practice were discussed for each emergent theme in regard to implementation and use, leadership, and culture. This study was significant as it describes the common formative assessment practices, types of leadership, and cultural characteristics of an upper elementary school who has effectively implemented common formative assessments and has experienced a 29% gain in mathematics scores since implementation. Discussion of study findings would be useful for school leaders seeking to implement common formative assessments in efforts to increase student achievement.

AB  - In this chapter the outcomes associated with response-to-intervention (RTI) implementation over 3 years are described. The analyses are both quantitative and qualitative and divided into student and teacher outcomes. The results shared include student measures such as changes in curriculum based measurement (CBM; used as a universal screening measure), changes in standardized test and state accountability data, movement between and within tiers of instruction, special education eligibility, data related to attendance and behavior, and the proportion of time students are engaged in academic behaviors. Results related to teacher instructional activities, use of progress monitoring (PM), fidelity of interventions, quality of teacher meetings, and teacher attitudes toward the RTI model are also provided. The following set of questions frame the process of evaluating student outcomes associated with the implementation of the model: 1) Within the RTI framework, what is the typical performance and growth rate of students at the implementation school on the universal screening measure (CBM) each fall and spring across 3 years? 2) Within the RTI framework, what is the typical performance and growth rate of students at the implementation school on the universal screening measure (CBM) each fall and spring across the three RTI tiers? 3) What is the impact of RTI on attendance and behavior? 4) What is the impact of RTI on academic engaged time? 5) How much student movement exists between and within tiers of the RTI model during the academic year? 6) What is the impact of RTI on special education eligibility? 7) What is the impact of RTI on the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) accountability tests (Minnesota's MCA-II tests)? The following questions examine the impact of the implementation of the model on teachers: 1) How has the implementation of RTI affected teacher use of PM procedures? 2) What is the fidelity of the interventions implemented at Tiers 2 and 3 of the RTI model? 3) What is the fidelity of the RTI data review meetings? 4) What are the teacher attitudes toward the primary components of the RTI model?

AB  - "Fast Feedback" is a feedback system for primary student writing. Developed in line with a Writer(s)-Within-Community model, and empirical research in the fields of writing instruction, feedback and self-regulation, this system uses individualized goals and focused feedback in the expectation that it will accelerate student progress. In 2015 nine teachers were asked to trial Fast Feedback, in seven classrooms, across three Wellington schools. Achievement data were collected for 136 student participants, and compared with equivalent data from students at a control school. A student survey and teacher interviews were also used. Data analysis revealed that the treatment group made significantly more progress than the control group (ES 0.5). It also revealed variability across classrooms. Data analysis suggests that process-oriented goals were most effective, and that the addressing of transcription skills was critical. Teachers observed that Fast Feedback was motivating for students, and encouraged student independence.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of formative assessment and learning style on student achievement in a Web-based learning environment. A quasi-experimental research design was used. Participants were 455 seventh grade students from 12 classes of six junior high schools. A Web-based course, named BioCAL, combining three different formative assessment strategies was developed. The formative assessment strategies included Formative Assessment Module of the Web-Based Assessment and Test Analysis system (FAM-WATA) (with six Web-based formative assessment strategies), Normal Module of Web-Based Assessment and Test Analysis system (N-WATA) (only with partial Web-based formative assessment strategy) and Paper and Pencil Test (PPT) (without Web-based formative assessment strategy). Subjects were tested using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, and assigned randomly by class into three groups. Each group took Web-based courses using one of the formative assessment strategies. Pre- and post-achievement testing was carried out. A one-way ANCOVA analysis showed that both learning style and formative assessment strategy are significant factors affecting student achievement in a Web-based learning environment. However, there is no interaction between these two factors. A post hoc comparison showed that performances of the FAM-WATA group are higher than the N-WATA and PPT groups. Learners with a ‘Diverger’ learning style performed best followed by, ‘Assimilator’, ‘Accommodator’, and ‘Converger’, respectively. Finally, FAM-WATA group students are satisfied with six strategies of the FAM-WATA.

AB  - The web-based formative assessment developed in this research is named Formative Assessment Module of the Web-based Assessment and Test Analysis System (FAM-WATA). FAM-WATA is a multiple-choice web-based formative assessment module containing six effective strategies: ‘repeat the test’, ‘correct answers are not given’, ‘query scores’, ‘ask questions’, ‘monitor answering history’, and ‘all pass and then reward’. This research explored the effectiveness of FAM-WATA, cognitive styles and e-learning, and student attitudes towards the six strategies of FAM-WATA. A total of 503 seventh-grade students in central Taiwan were valid in this research. Overall results indicated that students displayed a positive attitude towards the six strategies of FAM-WATA. In addition, results also showed that students in an e-learning environment equipped with FAM-WATA achieved better learning effectiveness, and that field independent students appeared to make better use of FAM-WATA strategies than field dependent students. This research concluded that FAM-WATA benefited student learning in an e-learning environment.

AB  - This research aims to develop a multiple-choice Web-based quiz-game-like formative assessment system, named GAM-WATA. The unique design of ‘Ask-Hint Strategy’ turns the Web-based formative assessment into an online quiz game. ‘Ask-Hint Strategy’ is composed of ‘Prune Strategy’ and ‘Call-in Strategy’. ‘Prune Strategy’ removes one incorrect option and turns the original 4-option item into a 3-option one. ‘Call-in Strategy’ provides the rate at which other test takers choose each option when answering a question. This research also compares the effectiveness of three different types of formative assessment in an e-Learning environment: paper-and-pencil test (PPT), normal Web-based test (N-WBT) and GAM-WATA. In total, 165 fifth grade elementary students (from six classes) in central Taiwan participated in this research. The six classes of students were then divided into three groups and each group was randomly assigned one type of formative assessment. Overall results indicate that different types of formative assessment have significant impacts on e-Learning effectiveness and that the e-Learning effectiveness of the students in the GAM-WATA group appears to be better. Students in the GAM-WATA group more actively participate in Web-based formative assessment to do self-assessment than students in the N-WBT group. The effectiveness of formative assessment will not be significantly improved only by replacing the paper-and-pencil test with Web-based test. The strategies included in GAM-WATA are recommended to be taken into consideration when researchers design Web-based formative assessment systems in the future.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorClassroom assessment is an important integral part in language teaching and learning process. It is one of main areas of the modern education science researches. Formative assessment is the mainstream assessment method of the current classroom assessment. It focuses on assessing on the students' learning process. It describes the overall progress of the students and the teacher can adjust the teaching appropriately and timely based on the feedback of the students. It is an effective way to promote the English learning interest of the students. Compared to the summative assessment, the purpose of formative assessment emphasizes on arousing the learning interest, training good learning habit and developing the learning autonomy ability in the process of students' learning. By the pre-questionnaire on English learning interest and the situation of English speaking activities of the eighty-five students from grade one in a rural area, the writer of the paper finds out that the English learning interest of the students has the tendency of decreasing and they don't enjoy speaking English activities. And the learning interest relates to the application of types of classroom assessment. This paper is to study two hypotheses of the study. One is that the appropriate types of formative assessment in English speaking activities will do a great deal to increase English learning interest of the students. Another is that the application of the formative assessment in English speaking activities may improve the English learning achievements of the students a lot. The purpose of the study is to arouse the students' English learning interest by changing the ways of classroom assessment application and to make the students enjoy English speaking activities. In this experiment the writer only applies the four types of formative assessment on the students of two classes from grade one, including questionnaire, observation, self and peer assessment, interview in the English speaking activities. Based on the result of pro-questionnaire survey and the comparison of mid-and final- examinations in the experiment, the two hypotheses are confirmed, namely, formative assessment is beneficial to promoting the English leaning interest of the students and improvement of English learning achievement. And some implications of the experiment are given in this part. The researcher also points out some limitations of the action research and gives some suggestions on further research in the end. Key words: formative assessment, learning interest, English speaking

AB  - The Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, is a standardized test administered by the College Board. In response to declining SAT scores over the past four years, the administration of a high school district in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois implemented an SAT intervention program. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this intervention program has had a statistically significant effect on student performance, as measured by post-intervention SAT scores as compared to the scores of a control group. The method used for this study was a causal-comparative design. The method involved the collection of quantitative information in the form of pre- and post-SAT data collected during the 2018–2019 school year Students participating were identified as those with pre-test SAT scores ranging from 960–1220. The collected data were evaluated using a test of significance, ANOVA, for repeated measures to examine differences among multiple means by comparing variance to determine the significance of the SAT Intervention program. The ANOVA was used as a statistical procedure to determine whether the mean difference between the two sets (i.e., students who participated in the intervention and students who did not). The overall results of the analyses indicated there was no evidence that the intervention improved English or math SAT scores, but did improve composite SAT scores. Analysis of the historical data from the SAT Intervention did not provide enough evidence to suggest that the intervention alone is accountable for the gains observed. The recommendation, based on the results observed over the 2018–2019 academic year, is that the SAT Intervention Program should be modified and reevaluated each subsequent year.

AB  - Providing tests enhances the retention of learned material compared with further study. This relationship has been known as the testing effect. Studies have shown that the testing effect can also be applied to the transfer of learning, i.e. novel demonstrations of the learned material. The author tested this relationship with Filipino Elementary School children (n = 32) of low socio-economic status in an underprivileged school setting. In a with-subjects experimental design, the participants underwent two different study procedures on two sets of visual symbols, including a study-only and a test-study condition. After a one hour retention interval, they took retrieval and transfer final tests on both sets. A significant testing effect (p < .05) was found only on final tests requiring transfer but not on final tests only requiring retrieval. Even though participants in higher Elementary School grades performed better on both final tests, there was no interaction effect of grade level with the testing effect. The present study confirms that the testing effect also applies to the transfer of learning, and that the testing effect is even bigger for transfer than for simple retrieval. The study also suggests that the testing effect applies to children in all grade levels of Elementary School, to children of low socio-economic status in the Philippine public school system, and to visual-symbolic materials.

AB  - As the effects of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act and its ensuing mandates for compliance are felt in classrooms across the United States, the issues of high-stakes testing and rigorous benchmark paradigms are becoming a daily challenge for teachers. NCLB mandates rigorous testing for every child in grades 3-8 in reading and math. Children who do not pass the tests will not move on to the next grade. Schools that do not improve their test scores every year by the federally determined increment called adequate yearly progress (AYP) also will face consequences. These schools may lose federal funding, and the federal government may ultimately restructure them. There are three related postulations that can be made about the culture of teaching: (1) the culture of teaching honors children, not content, as the focus of learning; (2) the culture of teaching honors continuous learning, collaboration, and mentoring; and (3) the culture of teaching honors collaborative problem solving, goal setting, and assessment. These assumptions honor the individuality of students and teachers, and have emerged from decades of research and practical implementation. They emphasize the unique problem-solving ability that has been shown to be a standard of good teaching. Paula Weaver, in this article, hopes to shed light upon how the testing requirements of NCLB affect the values from which these assumptions stem.

AB  - This study compares the effectiveness of two different assessment techniques; readiness assessment tests (RATs) and frequent quizzing. We report student perceptions of the impact of these techniques on the number of readings done prior to the class period, thorough reading of assignments, ability to follow class discussions, ability to participate in class, ability to prepare for exams and exam scores. We also examined student's overall preferences for assessment technique as well as how preferences varied by learning styles. Readiness assessment tests were generally better than frequent quizzes at encouraging students to do the readings prior to class, follow class discussions, and participate in class. A majority of students preferred readiness assessment tests to frequent quizzes. However, whereas global and/or intuitive learners preferred the readiness assessment tests, sequential and/or sensing learners preferred the quizzes. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - Written expression curriculum-based measurement is a quick and effective way to screen for writing difficulties and evaluate student progress during an intervention. In this study the scores of third and fourth grade students in the fall, winter, and spring were analyzed as related to grade level, gender, special education participation, and handwriting style. A cluster analysis was used to examine patterns of student scores. Implications related to gender and handwriting style are discussed. Writing scores indicate the need to examine accuracy and skill improvement in addition to overall fluency rates.

AB  - Causal modeling techniques were used to examine relationships among: (1) a curriculum-based special education measurement and evaluation system, (2) structure of instruction, and (3) achievement. All three constructs were stable over time. Teachers' accuracy in setting up student performance measurement was directly related to student achievement. (Author/DB)

AB  - As a promising tool for improving math education and closing the achievement gap, the use of educational technology has dramatically expanded in K-12 education in recent years, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. ASSISTments was one of the few digital learning programs recommended for use in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Sahni et al., 2021). Developed by researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, ASSISTments is a free online formative assessment platform that applies innovative technology in education. This study measured the possible long-term impact of ASSISTments on student learning. Findings from the study can help schools, districts, and states make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and adoption of technology-based programs, as well as the specific skills and knowledge that educators need to integrate technology into their schools effectively--potentially leading to improved student performance while saving time and money in the long run. By prioritizing evidence-based practices, schools and districts can track the impact of the technologies they adopt and hold themselves accountable for meeting their goals. Key findings include: (1) ASSISTments had a significant positive impact on student learning in the long term; (2) ASSISTments helped close opportunity gaps; and (3) ASSISTments benefited more those students whose schools had a higher percentage of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds or a lower percentage of White students.

AB  - Results are presented from two studies involving 190 primary and high school (Year 7) students and 146 older low-progress readers in the late primary years. These studies contribute towards the development of five 200 word standardised passages which may be employed interchangeably to monitor the performance of low-progress readers towards achieving functional literacy. The passages are shown to possess both high parallel form reliability (0.94 to 0.96) and internal consistency (0.97 to 0.99), and also good criterion validity (0.78 to 0.80) with reading accuracy. Appropriate growth in performance over the primary years is also demonstrated. These findings suggest that an extrapolated model of curriculum-based measurement (CBM), which incorporates elements of more traditional reading assessments, would overcome some of the problems associated with CBM.

AB  - Examined the value of training children in visual discrimination of letters and words in learning to read. Ss were pupils from a middle-class background in 12 1st-grade classes in 7 schools. 143 controls received only basic reading instruction. 152 experimental Ss also received, for 15 wks, 15 min of daily training in visual memory. This training included the flash-card technique that required the Ss to remember the specific words and letters they saw and to indicate on record sheets what they remembered. The program included discrimination among words and letters with similar visual images. Experimental Ss had lower initial mean reading scores but higher scores at the end of the program (p < .01). The Stanford Achievement Test of reading measured the performance of both groups. Experimental Ss were superior to controls in performance or improvement on total reading abilities, the word reading subtest, and the paragraph meaning subtest.

AB  - The effect on children's test scores of different item formats used in standardized mathematics achievement tests was investigated. In a Utah school, 40 second grade students completed a mathematics computation test using eight different formats derived from five standardized achievement tests. Identical content, taken from the most frequently occurring content in the standardized achievement tests examined, was tested with each format. Differences in test score between types of formats were statistically significant. These results indicate that what a student appears to have mastered in mathematics computation is substantially influenced by the format of the particular test used. Differences in scores between the various formats are not accounted for by the normative scaling of the different tests. Greater attention should be given to the effect of test item format in selecting and administering achievement tests. (Author/PN)

AB  - In response to federal and state legislation aimed at increasing student achievement through accountability of teachers and staff, many California school districts are in the process of defining student learning objectives and instituting procedures to evaluate these objectives in cost-effective ways. During 1978, the Santa Cruz City School District (SCCSD) initiated a process whereby teachers generated student objectives for their classes, and these objectives were coordinated with the district proficiencies required for graduation from eighth grade. Although many school districts have instated such criterion-referenced systems, few have evaluated the process by assessing student achievement. To determine the benefit of the criterion-referenced system to students in SCCSD, a formative evaluation study was conducted comparing standardized test scores of students in different years, prior to and after implementation of the system. The process of developing and measuring the learning objectives was carried out by teachers throughout the district in coordination with administrative staff members. Staff members provided support for the activities by giving inservice workshops on writing objectives and determining evaluative criteria. Teachers' annual performance evaluations were partially based upon how closely they came to achieving the learning objectives established for their classes. Standardized test scores (Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills) were collected for seventh and eighth grade students in one of the district junior high schools prior to and after the criterion-referenced system had been established. It was expected that pretest-posttest gains would be higher in the year after the system was implemented than the prior year. A second question in the study was whether the district developed proficiency tests correlated significantly with the CTBS scores, by way of validating the district tests. The results showed that, contrary to expectation, student achievement showed greater gains in the year prior to actual implementation of the system. There were also significant differences in achievement of boys and girls. This became an important factor since there was a greater proportion of girls in the year prior to establishing the criterion-referenced system. Since the confounding of gender with class year was unavoidable in the design of the study, conclusions were only tentative that the process of developing a criterion-referenced system was not advantageous to student achievement. It was suggested that a longitudinal study be conducted to look at effects of the system and to control for the imbalance in boys and girls during some school years. Given that greatest gains were seen in achievement during the year when the development of the process was underway, a likely conclusion is that the enthusiasm of teachers, resulting from involvement on a district-wide basis, impacted students more than the actual system of specifically defined and coordinated learning objectives. If this is so, a worthy recommendation is that the administration of SCCSD plan to use a similar format in future district problem-solving activities. The differences between boys and girls in the district could also become a focus of attention for administrators rather than accepted as a normal situation for students of this age. The correlation between the district-defined proficiency tests and the CTBS scores were significant although not so large in magnitude that substitution of one test for the other is warranted.

AB  - The purpose of this action research study was to describe the effectiveness of a virtual learning system (VLS) on college preparatory biology students' pre- and posttest scores. Data were gathered from observations of students using the VLS for video lectures, practice tests, reviewing, and other online simulations in the spring of 2017. Data were also collected using a pretest and a posttest designed by the participant-researcher before and after the implementation of the VLS. A t test was used to analyze the pre- and posttest quantitative data, and the constant comparative method was used to analyze the qualitative data from the formative assessments. Findings included the following themes: cultivating habits of student self-monitoring, developing student decision making, and improved equity and access to higher level science courses. The results of the present action research study were used to develop an action plan to enable other science educators at White Hall High School to make informed decisions regarding the implementation of a VLS in their classrooms to enhance student learning.

AB  - In order to ensure that schools support students' learning, educational attainment, success in the workplace and healthy development, we need a robust research literature on student outcomes beyond average achievement test scores. This dissertation includes three papers that report on elementary and secondary student outcomes other than average achievement in order to gain a more nuanced understanding of how students are faring and the effects of school policies and practices. In each paper, I explore outcomes across different types of students (according to categories such as race/ethnicity, income, and language learner status) because assessing heterogeneity in outcomes is essential to being able to address the needs of students from all backgrounds.The first paper examines the prevalence and predictors of class absences in middle and high schools using administrative data from a California district. Prior literature on prevalence of absences has focused on full-day absences or total absences to class without distinguishing whether the student was absent to all their classes or only some of their classes that day. I find that about half of all absences to class are on days the student attended at least one other class, meaning that total absences in secondary school are much higher than official Average Daily Attendance statistics. This finding suggests a need to better understand and address absences to class. I examine the extent to which characteristics of the class and of students predict class absences. Students are substantially more likely to have unexcused absences to first period, followed by seventh period, compared to other periods, while class subject or whether it is a core subject class are less important to student attendance. Black, Hispanic, and low-income students have more unexcused class absences than other students, even with extensive controls or within the same neighborhood or classroom, and first period has a differentially stronger effect on these students. This quantitative analysis can help inform school efforts to reduce absences by indicating the types of classes and students most at risk of class absences. In addition, I identify themes in qualitative interviews with district and school staff regarding reasons for class absences and possible methods for reducing absences.The second paper examines the effects of No Child Left Behind high-stakes accountability on socio-emotional outcomes using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey -- Kindergarten Cohort 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Many people have worried that high-stakes testing would lead to worse socio-emotional outcomes such as higher test anxiety and lower interest in school due to teaching to the test. Using a quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences approach, I find a lack of support for the assertion that high-stakes standardized testing hurts students on average in terms of their socio-emotional outcomes. I find no statistically significant effects on average. At the same time, I find substantial differences between impacts for student subgroups, whereby some subgroups such as Hispanic students appear to benefit from consequential accountability while others such as African American students do not.The third paper (coauthored with Ben Master, Susanna Loeb, and Jim Wyckoff) seeks to identify the characteristics and learning experiences of general education teachers who are differentially effective at promoting math achievement among English Language Learners (ELLs) compared to non-ELLs. Many educators have suggested that identifying or developing teachers with skills specific to ELLs' instructional needs may be critical to addressing the achievement gap between ELLs and non-ELLs in math. However, the evidence base to test this assertion is sparse. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there were differences in MCT2 scores between students who attended a school district that used MSPMS and students who attended a school district that did not use MSPMS. The data for this study were archived and consisted of math and language arts MCT2 scores for two groups of students. The independent variable was the use of MSPMS for progress monitoring and the dependent variable was student scores on the MCT2. All data were analyzed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) statistical procedure. In this study the 2008-2009 math and language arts MCT2 scores were the covariate. Hypothesis one stated that there was no statistically significant difference in the MCT2 language scores of students in Grades 4-8 in a school district using MSPMS and MCT2 language scores of students in Grades 4-8 in a district not using MSPMS while controlling for pre-test differences. The results of the first hypothesis indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the 2009-2010 language arts MCT2 scores of a school district that used MSPMS and a district that did not use MSPMS. The district that did not use the MSPMS had higher MCT2 Language Arts overall and higher scores in fourth and sixth grades. Hypothesis two stated that there was no statistically significant difference in the MCT2 math scores of students in grades 4-8 in a school district that used the MSPMS and MCT2 math scores of students in grades 4-8 in a district that did not use the MSPMS while controlling for pre-test differences. The results of the second hypothesis indicated that there was not a significant difference in the 2009-2010 math MCT2 scores of the school district that used the MSPMS and the school district that did not use the MSPMS. The district that did not use the MSPMS had higher MCT2 Math scores overall and higher scores in sixth grade. The district that did use the MSPMS had higher MCT2 math scores in eighth grade. Further study should explore larger populations, assessment instruments of different lengths and fidelity of teacher implementation.

AB  - While it is generally acknowledged that increased use of formative assessment (or assessment for learning) leads to higher quality learning, it is often claimed that the pressure in schools to improve the results achieved by students in externally-set tests and examinations precludes its use. This paper reports on the achievement of secondary school students who worked in classrooms where teachers made time to develop formative assessment strategies. A total of 24 teachers (2 science and 2 mathematics teachers, in each of six schools in two LEAs) were supported over a six-month period in exploring and planning their approach to formative assessment, and then, beginning in September 1999, the teachers put these plans into action with selected classes. In order to compute effect sizes, a measure of prior attainment and at least one comparison group was established for each class (typically either an equivalent class taught in the previous year by the same teacher, or a parallel class taught by another teacher). The mean effect size in favour of the intervention was 0.32.

AB  - In a climate of assessment and accountability, school districts are constantly on the search for product solutions to the pressing issue of student reading performance, as assessed by annual state standardized accountability testing. In an attempt to increase student reading growth rates, some districts are turning to formative assessment systems, such as the formative online reading assessment Diagnostic Online Reading Assessment, or DORA (commercially available from Let's Go Learn, Inc.), in order to encourage more differentiated classroom instruction and as a growth monitoring tool for instruction. The implementation of DORA, while top-down in nature, is being done in collaboration with the product developers, whose professional development model utilizes a Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) framework, providing for extensive administrator support, modeling of usage, using a teacher cohort model, and allowing for teacher concerns to be address during the professional development cycle. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects in student reading growth of the teacher-level implementation decisions and in the top-down, district wide implementation of a formative online reading assessment, as part of district-wide measures to improve student reading performance, and subsequently, student reading test scores. Data was collected from a large, urban school district in Southern California, with a large minority population, many of whom speak English as a second language. Existing student DORA data was collected, while a survey was administered to teachers to collect teacher-level professional development implementation data. Student data and teacher data were analyzed using regression analysis and Hierarchical Linear Modeling to determine 1) the relationship between teacher-level professional development implementation decisions and the overall teacher use of DORA, and 2) the relationship between teacher-level professional development implementation decisions and student DORA growth over time. For the first research question, it was determined that none of the study variables pertaining to teacher professional development and implementation decisions were statistically significant predictors of overall teacher usage of the DORA formative assessment program. For the second and third research questions, while it was found that student DORA growth curves did vary by teacher in grades two, three, and five. Few of the study variables pertaining to teacher professional development and program implementation accounted for variance in student growth curves at the teacher level, and none consistently across grade level. Although many of the study variables pertaining to professional development were not found to be significant in this study, future study regarding the implementation of large-scale formative assessment programs should examine how the effects of this professional development vary as the time of the implementation vary. Further research should also examine the effects of a Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) on the implementation of district-wide formative assessment programs. Within a climate of assessment and accountability, more emphasis is being placed on formative assessment use in the classroom, and further study of these formative assessments is warranted.

AB  - A two-article dissertation format is provided. The first article is a literature review of Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) as an intervention and has three purposes: a) describe foundational components of CBM; b) explain CBM as an intervention versus an outcome measure; and c) examine connections between CBM and RtI. The second article, a meta-analytic study, addresses CBM in mathematics (CBM-M) as an intervention and examines specific outcomes for students in grades K-12, including those in general education and special education, when detailed feedback was utilized, and when detailed feedback was not incorporated. The three research questions include: (a) What are the effects of implementing CBM-M as an intervention when digits correct are assessed for computation and concepts and applications? (b) What are the effects of CBM-M as an intervention when problems correct are assessed for computation and concepts and applications? and (c) What are the effects on overall mathematics achievement when CBM-M as an intervention is implemented? Upon completion of the meta-analysis, results indicated that when digits correct are assessed for computation, all students had a higher statistically significant effect when detailed feedback was utilized. More specifically, students in general education experience higher effects when detailed feedback is used, while students in special education benefit from CBM with or without detailed feedback. No studies were found for addressing concepts and applications with digits correct. When addressing problems correct for computation, all students had the most statistically significant benefit when detailed feedback was incorporated, yet students in general education had the most benefit. Much more data is needed in the area of problems correct for concepts and applications. From the data gathered, small non-statistically significant effects were found for all students without the inclusion of detailed feedback, yet a negative non-statistically significant effect was found for students in special education. Not enough data was found to assess the use of detailed feedback. In terms of overall mathematical achievement, data was only found for the inclusion of detailed feedback. Results indicated that students in general education achieve small statistically significant effects, while students in special education did not show an effect at all. Overall, using detailed feedback produced higher statistically significant effects for students in both general and special education. Most research has been conducted in the area of computation for grades 3-6. Much more research is needed in the areas of concepts and applications, overall mathematical achievement, and at the secondary grade levels. Both articles, the literature review and meta-analytic study, are discussed separately.

AB  - The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) measures the English language proficiency of foreign students who apply for higher education in the United States. It is administered according to a strict schedule through the International and Special Center (I&SC) testing program or at ad hoc intervals by institutional users as part of the TOEFL Institutional Testing Program (INST). This study investigated the patterns of test taking and score change for examinees who repeated the TOEFL in an International or I&SC administration within 24 to 60 months after initial testing. Data for examinees who repeated TOEFL within 1 to 12 months following initial testing by institutions participating in the TOEFL INST were also analyzed. In both the I&SC and INST samples, TOEFL repeaters registered substantial average net gains in performance. Findings suggested that there may be differences among national-linguistic groups in typical rate of acquisition of proficiency in English. The magnitude of the average score changes found to be associated with test repetition for repeaters, combined with relatively strong differences among national-linguistic groups in both incidence of test repetition and mean score change, indicates that for purposes of summary reporting on TOEFL performance (e.g., in defining basic reference groups), it is important to specify the test-repetition status of the gorups of examinees involved.

AB  - Special day class students struggle with reading fluency. Their lack of fluency impedes their reading comprehension. The purpose of this study was to determine if a combination of strategies delivered simultaneously would significantly improve reading fluency in students with a learning disability who must attend an alternative school. Instructional synergy, meaning the combined efforts of many strategies are more effective than one strategy alone, is used to intensify instruction. The study sought to increase the instruction level and grade level reading fluency of students with special needs who attend an alternative school. Employing a multiple baseline single subject design, the study examined the effectiveness of three reading fluency interventions delivered simultaneously on the reading fluency of four 7th and 8th grade students in a special day class. Baseline reading levels were established using the BADER Reading and Language Graded Word Lists and Graded Word Passages, the Gray Oral Reading Test (GORT) and curriculum-based oral reading fluency passages (CBM). Then, for a period of three school weeks, students received instruction through the use of three research based reading instructional strategies: read aloud, phrasing, and repeated reading. CBMs were used to monitor student progress in fluency during the three week period, and post tests using the measures listed above were collected at the end of the three weeks. Graphic analysis was used to determine whether students were making progress on the CBMs, and their rate of improvement (ROI) was compared to published national norms. Results indicate that the instructional synergy approach was effective for some but not all students. This study has the potential to direct social change by employing research-based strategies in context for students with disabilities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The literature on formative assessment shows great potential for significant improvements in student achievement. However, little is known about combining formative-assessment strategies, based in large part on short-cycle and medium-cycle assessments, with continuous quality improvement concepts to improve student achievement in mathematics at the middle school level. This study examined the first-year effect of a continuous quality formative-assessment (CQFA) program on eighth-grade students' high-stakes test scores in one urban New Jersey middle school. Test score data analysis revealed that the CQFA program significantly improved the performance of eighth-grade students, with an effect size of 1.00, and that improvements occurred in all demographic groups studied and in all math content areas. Based on these results, the researcher recommends that schools searching for ways to increase mathematics achievement adopt a CQFA program. It was also recommended that future research be conducted regarding the short-term and long-term impacts of CQFA programs on mathematics achievement at the elementary, middle, and high school levels.

AB  - The study analyzed 2005 posttest data compared to 2008 posttest data to determine student end of school year academic achievement outcomes across three academic levels (above average, average, and below average chemistry potential) and two teacher homework evaluation methods (assigned but not graded and assigned and graded) on teacher prepared 11th-grade assessments, district prepared 11th-grade assessment, and district graduation requirement physical science strand 11th-grade science Essential Learner Outcome assessment. Overall, results indicated that students with above average (n = 16), average, (n = 17) and below average (n = 14) chemistry potential whom were given teacher assigned and graded chemistry homework compared to students with above average (n = 17), average (n = 15), and below average (n = 19) chemistry potential whom were given teacher assigned but not graded chemistry homework had statistically significantly higher independent t test matter homework scores while atoms, naming, and reactions homework scores were generally in the direction of higher but not significant scores for students given graded homework regardless of their chemistry potential. Furthermore, students of above average and below average chemistry potential who were given assigned and graded chemistry homework performed statistically significantly better on the 11th-grade district prepared chemistry final and the district prepared physical science strand Essential Learner Outcome assessment t test results compared to students with the same chemistry potential given assigned but not graded chemistry homework, suggesting that the graded chemistry condition may have contributed to improved long term learning and retention of chemistry knowledge. Finally, the coefficient of determination (r2 = .95) measure of strength of relationship between not completing, not graded chemistry homework and a corresponding drop in chemistry assessment scores for all students was 95% and the coefficient of determination (r2 = .82) measure of strength of relationship between not completing, graded chemistry homework and a corresponding drop in chemistry assessment scores for all students was 82%. While not implying causality the study findings suggest that students who complete more homework, not graded or graded, have a higher probability of improving their chemistry assessment scores regardless of their chemistry potential.

AB  - This research aims at finding the way to develop the assessment for learning of the humanistic (AfL-H) model in Mathematics at elementary schools. This is developmental research of the Hopkins & Clark model. The experimental subjects are 67 mathematics teachers and 375 elementary students in Grade. The data were analyzed in two stages using qualitative and quantitative methods. The experiment of the AfL-H model uses repeated measures analysis. The research results indicate that the AfL-H model developed here has the following main characteristics: 1. the learning provides greater fairness and respects all (learners), and 2. The assessment respects each student's varied abilities based on their own abilities. Several findings in this research are: (1) students receive greater respects regarding the abilities they have in the assessment; (2) the information obtained using the AfL-H model is accurate and as actually needed by students, (3) the application of the AfL-H model in mathematics learning improves student's motivation, confidence, self-awareness, behavior during learning, and ability in Mathematics, and (4) students' learning progress is shown by individual and class profiles.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to (a) examine the psychometric properties of The Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System for Infants and Children (AEPS Test); (b) provide a process for establishing psychometric properties for other Curriculum Based Assessments (CBAs); and (c) identify and guide evaluation and subsequent revisions of the AEPS Test. Data were entered from early childhood teams from across the United States into an online data management system called the AEPS Interactive (AEPSi). Analyses include application and discussion of Classical Test Theory as well as Rasch Modeling techniques. Results of the study indicate the AEPS Test cannot measure the higher ability levels or very low ability levels across the developmental areas because there are currently no items which measure these extreme ability levels. The AEPS Test items are in correct developmental sequence, with only a few items out of order in each AEPS Test area. Specific AEPS Test items which are biased for gender or developmental status were identified. Analyses determined that the item reliability and person reliability values were well above the acceptable range for the AEPS Test. The analyses conducted to examine how well the response categories functioned indicated that all three response categories (i.e., 0, 1, 2) for the AEPS Test are being utilized. The analyses indicate the scoring scale is not sensitive enough to detect small changes in developmental progress. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine if a relationship existed between metacognitive instruction and students' growth rate for fluency, accuracy, self-correction rates, and comprehension in reading. The research question that guided this study was: To what extent is there a relationship between metacognitive instruction using Reciprocal Teaching method and increasing student success for first-grade emergent readers as evidenced by Curriculum-based Measurements and STAR Accelerated Reader tests. Constructivism theory was used to develop an understanding of learning that asserts student learning happens when students make meaning for themselves. The sample for this study was a convenient sample of 16 first-grade emergent readers. The primary investigator utilized three assessments at the beginning and end of the research period. These assessments included, Curriculum-Based Measurement, Qualitative Reading Inventory, sixth edition, and the STAR Accelerated Reader test. The assessment results were compared, and a positive relationship was found between metacognitive instruction and the student success achieved through the calculation of a two-tailed t test. These results offer insight into the value of instruction for emergent readers that goes beyond simple decoding into a deeper comprehension and metacognitive instruction.

AB  - OF THE EIGHT INITIAL EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED BY RESEARCH AND INSTRUCTION (R AND I) UNITS, ESTABLISHED IN WISCONSIN SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE EXEMPLARY INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THEM THROUGH A PROGRAM OF RESEARCH, THREE EXPERIMENTS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS. IN ONE, 99 SIXTH-GRADERS RECEIVED THREE TYPES OF SPELLING INSTRUCTION--WORKBOOKS, AN INTEGRATED APPROACH IN WHICH STUDENTS WERE TAUGHT A SPELLING METHOD AND WERE LED TO APPLY THIS IN WRITING NEW WORDS, AND INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION. ON RECALL AND RECOGNITION TESTS AND A PROOFREADING TASK, PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS WERE MAINTAINED REGARDLESS OF THE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION USED, AND FEMALES SCORED HIGHER THAN MALES. SPELLING ERRORS ON THEME WRITING REVEALED THAT WORKBOOK INSTRUCTION SHOWED THE LEAST TRANSFER TO A WRITING SITUATION. HOWEVER, FREQUENCY OF DICTIONARY USAGE WAS MARKEDLY HIGHEST UNDER THE SPELLING WORKBOOK APPROACH. TWO OTHER EXPERIMENTS, INVOLVING NINE-WEEK STUDIES IN HANDWRITING INSTRUCTION, WERE CONDUCTED BY THIRD- AND FOURTH-GRADE R AND I UNITS. LEGIBILITY RATINGS OF HANDWRITING SAMPLES UNDER NORMAL, FAST, AND BEST CONDITIONS INDICATED THAT ON THE THIRD-GRADE LEVEL THE TRADITIONAL GROUP-METHOD OF INSTRUCTION WAS MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE DIAGNOSTIC INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH. IN THE FOURTH-GRADE LEVEL EXPERIMENT, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN IMPROVEMENT WERE FOUND BETWEEN THESE METHODS OF INSTRUCTION, BUT IMPROVEMENT IN LEGIBILITY WAS GREATER IN GRADE 4, WITH EITHER TREATMENT, THAN IN GRADE 3. OTHER UNITS CONDUCTED FIVE ADDITIONAL SHORT EXPERIMENTS IN READING, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WERE OBTAINED. (DL)

AB  - Evaluated was grade 6 of a televised arithmetic program, "Patterns in Arithmetic." The major goal was to determine whether or not the technique of item-sampling could be incorporated into a design effective for formative curriculum evaluation. Approximately 60 classes near Madison, Wisconsin, participated in the study. Tests were administered at four times during the year to a random sample of students to provide a profile of performance change. As a result of these tests, changes were made in the television presentations. It was concluded that item-sampling had the following advantages over traditional achievement testing: (1) more detailed information is provided, (2) planning and review are more effective, (3) transient aspects become evident, (4) revision is more effectively accomplished, and (5) it is more economical of time and money.

AB  - A summative evaluation of the instructional television series "Reading for a Reason" was conducted during the spring of 1982 as part of the premier showing of the series over the Wisconsin Educational Television Network. The series consisted of eight programs designed to teach skills for content area reading to seventh and eighth grade students. Each program presented skills and techniques that could be used to get meaning and retain information from reading textbooks and other expository materials. The study involved over 1,300 students who were given a pretest and posttest, and over 60 teachers who completed questionnaires or supplied supplementary information. A version of the Solomon Four Group Design was used because this design makes it possible to determine the effects of testing. The tests were composed of three parts--a reading style inventory, a comprehension test of the TV series elements, and a reading comprehension test. Findings from the evaluation show that (1) students at grade 7 who had used the series reported using techniques that were conducive to effective reading more frequently than did the control group; (2) students at both grade levels learned statistically more about specific skills presented in the program than did the control group; and (3) taking into consideration the pretest scores, students in grade 7 who used the series scored significantly higher on the main idea reading scale. Teachers on the whole reported being satisfied with the series and gave the series and its manual a positive overall rating. (HOD)

AB  - Educational achievement matters for all students. To meet the challenges of rapidly changing global demands, students need to possess what are termed 21st-century skills: creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and communication. A deep conceptual understanding and use of mathematical processes plays a part in being a 21st-century learner. This qualitative action research study sought to address local problems of practice that present barriers to acquisition of mathematical skills for all students. Specifically, the study sought to address the disconnect that existed at a school site between the predominant instructional methods employed by teachers and instructional practices that support students’ deep conceptual understanding of mathematics.Over the course of the 2018–2019 school year, teachers at the treatment site implemented changes in their instructional practices in mathematics. Teachers in Grades 4 through 6 incorporated the formative assessment process into their regular math instruction. At the end of the school year, student achievement data from the CAASPP summative mathematics exam, were collected and compared to the previous year’s exam to measure the impact the change may have had on student performance. The findings indicate that all grade levels showed an increase in the percentage of students scoring Level 3 (Standard Met) or Level 4 (Standard Exceeded). Not only did the overall population demonstrate an increase, but traditionally underserved groups within the population also showed improvement across all grades. To strengthen any claims based on the results of the treatment group’s data, a control group was used as a comparison. In short, the control group did not experience the same improvements as the treatment group.Since the intent of action research is to provide answers to problems of practice at the local level, the recommendations made target the school site and district level. Based on the study findings, three recommendations are made: First, based on the positive student achievement results, it is recommended staff at the treatment site continue to develop their understanding and use of the formative assessment process. Second, because the environment that led to less than effective teacher practices was not one that supported teachers as reflective practitioners, I recommend that leadership throughout the district work toward creating an environment that encourages and promotes reflective practice. Finally, because the culture in the district has been tainted by past practices involving data from high-stakes tests, my third recommendation is that district data discussions be designed and guided to support teachers’ understanding and use of the data with a goal of changing their mental models about assessment.

AB  - This study asserts that central examinations need not necessarily be those administered by the government; they can be examinations centralized at some administrative level, but in any case, they are external to the school. This study also assessed the impact of central examinations on the functioning of the education system and students academic performance using data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (renamed Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) (TIMSS; 1994-1995) and the TIMSS-Repeat (1998-1999). Data on nationally representative samples of middle-school students are available from 39 countries for the TIMSS and 38 for the TIMSS-Repeat, with 23 countries participating in both studies. In all, about 450,000 students were represented. The international evidence of both TIMSS studies confirms that central examinations are a powerful accountability device. Student performance in mathematics and science is substantially higher in school systems with central examinations than those without central examinations, and this is true for students from all performance quartiles and family backgrounds. Parents, administrator, schools, teachers, and students all appear to respond favorably to the changed incentive environment created by centralexams by behaving more favorably to students educational achievement. Parental involvement grows more informed and effective, and opportunistic behavior of schools and teachers is curbed. An appendix discusses construction of the TIMSS Repeat database. (Contains 4 figures, 9 tables, and 32 references.) (SLD)

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between attempting online formative assessments and performance of students. The study is motivated by the dearth in research in the area of online formative assessment. The study reports mixed result of such relationship. A relationship was reported between attempting online formative assessments and performance in the mid-semester exam and each topic in the mid-semester exam. On the contrary, such relationship was not reported in regard to performance in the final exam and most topics examined in the final exam. The reason behind such findings can be attributed to the difference in the structure of questions in the final exam compared to those provided in online formative assessments, difference in complexity of topics and higher workload of students in studying specific topics. The findings of the present study have implications for accounting educators in regard to the use of on-line formative assessments and development of syllabus.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effect of formative assessment based learning on students' conceptual understanding levels regarding basic astronomical concepts. The study was conducted in a public primary school with 24 5th graders. The study group was applied a 3 phased teaching process based on formative assessment for the duration of 4 lesson periods. The conceptual understanding levels of students were specified by using 4 formative assessment probes prior to and after the process. Findings were presented and assessed in forms of percentage and frequency together with sample student answers. Prior to the teaching process it was determined that conceptual understanding levels of students regarding basic astronomy were rather low and students had developed various misconceptions. The reason for formation of day and night "is the exchange of location of the Sun and the Moon," the reason for lunar phases "is the Moon being a light source and radiating light from its different parts in different periods," the reason for different seasons to emerge "is the distance change of Earth from the Sun, in terms of coming closer and moving away" were some frequently observed misconceptions. After the activities the conceptual understanding levels of students showed increase. It was, nevertheless, challenging for them to explain their correct answers. This indicates the necessity of more studies to be conducted in order to develop scientific reasoning skills of students. This study recommends teachers to use formative assessment based education, which proved to be effective in teaching basic astronomical concepts, in science classes actively.

AB  - This study connected research on formative assessment, motivation, and conceptual change. In particular, it examined three research questions: (1) Can formative assessment improve students' motivational beliefs? (2) Can formative assessment improve students' achievement in science and bring about conceptual change? and (3) Are students' science achievement and conceptual change correlated with their motivational beliefs? Formative assessment in this study refers to assessments embedded in an inquiry-based curriculum. To answer those questions, a randomized experiment was conducted. One thousand and two 6th or 7th graders of 12 teachers in 12 different schools in six states participated in the study. The 12 teachers were matched in pairs and randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. The experimental group employed embedded formative assessments while teaching a science curriculum unit and the control group taught the same unit without formative assessments. All the students were given a motivation survey and one or more achievement tests at pre- and posttest. By comparing the experimental and control students' motivation and achievement scores at pretest and posttest, I examined whether the formative assessment treatment affected students' motivation, learning, and conceptual change. By correlating students' posttest motivation, achievement as well as conceptual change scores, I examined whether students' motivation was related to their achievement and conceptual change. Analyses indicated that, the embedded assessments used by the experimental group did not significantly influence students' motivation, achievement, or conceptual change compared to students in the control group. Most motivation beliefs were correlated with students' achievement in a way similar to what has been reported in the literature. They were not correlated with students' conceptual change scores as hypothesized. Teachers, as well as some contextual factors associated with teachers, were extremely influential on students' motivation, achievement, and conceptual change; teacher effects overshadowed the treatment effect. This study revealed many of the challenges and problems teachers, researchers and randomized experiments are likely to encounter. It also highlighted the difficulty and importance of high-fidelity formative assessment implementation. Finally, it suggested that a cognitive approach in studying conceptual change still has great value to further research.

AB  - Formative assessment was hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on students' science achievement and conceptual change, either directly or indirectly by enhancing motivation. We designed and embedded formatives assessments within an inquiry science unit. Twelve middle-school science teachers with their students were randomly assigned either to an experimental group (N = 6), provided with embedded formative assessment, or control group (N = 6). Teachers varied significantly as to their impact on student motivation, achievement, and conceptual change. But the impact of the formative assessment treatment on these outcomes was not statistically significant. Variation in both teachers' classroom management and the degree to which they used informal formative assessment, regardless of group, were conjectured as possible reasons for the absence of an overall formative assessment effect.

AB  - This study examined the effect of learning progression-aligned formal embedded formative assessment on conceptual change and achievement in middle-school science. Fifty-two sixth graders were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. Both groups were taught about sinking and floating by the same teacher with identical curriculum materials and activities. The experimental group received, in addition, three sets of formal embedded formative assessments with qualitative feedback as to how to improve their understandings aligned with an expected learning progression during instruction. The control group spent the corresponding time between new curriculum activities conducting curriculum-specific extension activities. Overall, the experimental group experienced on average greater conceptual change than the control group. The experimental group also scored higher on average than the control group on general achievement tests, especially the performance assessment. This study supported the contention, then, that embedding formal formative assessments within a curricular sequence built around an expected learning progression is a useful way to promote conceptual change along that learning progression in science classrooms.

AB  - Engaging in self-testing is often a more effective strategy for retaining information than is restudying the target material. This testing benefit has been found in numerous studies and across a wide variety of manipulations and materials. Despite these common results, students remain largely unaware of the benefits of self-testing. We conducted three experiments using ecologically valid materials (statistics concepts and chemical elements) to determine whether student subjects could be made aware of the benefits of self-testing and consequently engage in voluntary self-testing. A within-subject testing benefit was successfully replicated in two experiments. However, little support was found for the hypothesis that subjects could be brought to exhibit voluntary, covert self-testing behavior. These results present a challenge to the field regarding effective means of eliciting appreciation and self-regulated use of the testing effect among students and thereby improve learning outcomes.

AB  - Self-testing is one of the most reliable and powerful memory benefits known to cognitive science. Unfortunately, many students omit this strategy in favor of less effective study techniques such as restudying. The superiority of self-testing to restudying is known as the testing effect (e.g., Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Applied interventions have been used to attempt to increase self-testing behaviors in student populations, but have so far been unable to draw strong conclusions due to the indirectness of their measurements and incompleteness of their experimental design. Furthermore, these past interventions have been conducted entirely in person, limiting their practical utility relative to the use of an on-demand and widely distributable format. In the present investigation, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Quiz-Me online intervention that seeks to elicit increased use of the testing effect with (Experiment 1) or without (Experiment 2) an in-person lecture component, as well as with (Experiment 2) or without (Experiment 1) random assignment to a control intervention. These experiments also improved upon past research by using more direct assessment of study strategies that students appreciate and use, by assessing individual differences in psychological characteristics, and by establishing benchmark levels of student conversion from 'restudiers' into 'self-testers.' Results indicate that in-class lecture components are necessary for eliciting large-magnitude changes to self-testing appreciation and adoption, but that online interventions are nonetheless effective. Despite being smaller in magnitude, they are more strongly associated with changes to testing effect appreciation and changes to strategy use than a control intervention. These findings can be used by instructors and the developers of educational tools to refine the characteristics of future interventions into raising awareness and use of the testing effect among students.

AB  - We explored how a progress monitoring and instructional management system can be used to help educators differentiate instruction and meet the wide-ranging learning needs of their increasingly diverse classrooms. We compared classrooms in 24 states that used a curriculum-based progress monitoring and instructional management system, Accelerated Math, to same school control classrooms that did not use it. Among the major findings were the following: • At every grade level there were large differences in grade equivalent score and percentile gains for students in the experimental and control classrooms. • Gains were experienced across the achievement spectrum. An analysis of low-, middle-, and high-achieving students showed consistent rates of gain for each math objective mastered. • Intervention integrity had a significant effect on student achievement. • Teachers using the progress monitoring and instructional management system spent more time providing individual versus group instruction and felt better able to meet the individual needs of their students. • Significantly more students who were in classrooms where teachers used the progress monitoring and instructional management system reported that they like math, help each other with math, and like math better this year than last year. Addition of a progress monitoring and instructional management system to ongoing mathematics instruction improves mathematics outcomes for students. The effects of the program clearly are a function of intervention integrity; when progress monitoring and instructional management practices are implemented with high fidelity or integrity, the mathematics performance of all students is significantly enhanced. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - A study of all Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores reported to Hofstra University between September 1963 and February 1968 revealed that 27 persons had repeated the verbal part of the GRE, 27 retook the quantitative part, and 39 retook the advanced test. The interval between test and retest ranged from 2 to 40 months. The GRE scores of students who took the examination more than once were compared, and efforts were made to relate changes in the scores to the time that elapsed between the taking and retaking of the examination. The data revealed that a higher score was obtained by 59% of those retaking the verbal portion, 70% of those retaking the quantitative section, and 90% of those repeating the advanced test. Although the results are tentative because of the smallness of the sample, it is concluded that the effect of retaking the GRE varies, depending on the section of the test taken and when it is taken. The average increase in scores on the verbal section was 21, and there was little relationship between the increase and the time period between test and retest. The greatest increase was obtained on the quantitative test when it was retaken after one or two months, and the average increase was 30 points. The increase obtained in the advanced test scores was greater when there was a longer lapse of time between first and second administrations, and the average increase obtained was 64 points. (WM)

AB  - This study aimed to explore students' problem-solving abilities of heat and temperature through the 5E learning cycle with formative e-assessment. The research used mixed-method with embedded experimental design. The data was obtained through pretest and posttest problem-solving abilities with open-ended questions. The results showed that students' problem-solving abilities had increased with an average Normalized-gain value of 0.40 (lower medium category) and effect size value of 4.55 (strong category). The student's problem-solving process on useful description indicators, physics approach, specific application of physics, mathematical procedures, and logical progression undergo positive changes even though the increase is still in the low category. Indicators that have the highest increment in succession were specific applications of physics, useful descriptions, and physics approaches.

AB  - Recent reform in K-12 science advocates for fostering a new type of integrated knowledge, where disciplinary ideas are learned through the practices of scientists and engineers. Moreover, when fostering this knowledge, the reform emphasizes the need to illuminate to students the practices of scientists and engineers and to promote learning by making learning relevant to students’ lives. This dissertation addresses the reform’s vision in the context of classroom formative assessments. An online assessment called the 4R Activity was designed and embedded in a middle school climate change curriculum. Similar to scientists and engineers, students in the 4R Activity built knowledge products by receiving and providing double-blinded reviews and using the reviews to revise their products. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to investigate: (a) students’ achievement outcomes before and after participating in the 4R Activity; (b) the quality of the products generated during the 4R Activity; and (c) students’ perspectives on different aspects of the 4R Activity. A fixed effects regression model was estimated to compare the achievement outcomes of the 4R Activity participants (N=173, intervention) to those who used a conventional formative assessment (N=226, control) within the same curriculum. The 4R Activity participants demonstrated achievement gains that were, on average, 2.2 times higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, in the 4R Activity the achievement gains were highest for traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences (e.g., females, African Americans). Next, qualitative techniques were used to examine the patterns and characteristics of students’ artifacts (e.g., revised products, peer review) over three 4R Activity cycles. Findings revealed that over time students incorporated feedback to construct high quality knowledge products and provided comprehensive peer reviews. Twenty-two students’ perspectives on the 4R Activity were documented through semi-structured interviews. Students’ accounts revealed their awareness of connections between aspects of the 4R Activity and their interests (e.g., playing sports) as well as connections between the activity and the work of scientists and engineers. Together the studies showcase how a formative assessment resource can be used to promote learning, engage students in the practices of professionals and elicit students’ interests and experiences to inform further learning.

AB  - • Analyzes effects of test preparation for the same students on different types of math and science tests. • Uses students fixed effects methodology to identify unbiased estimates of effects. • Controls for previous math and science performance. • Estimates effects of test prep for male and female students. • Discusses the implications of the results in the Russian context. A central concern surrounding test-based accountability is that teachers may narrow teaching practices to improve test performance on a curriculum-based specific knowledge test rather than student learning more broadly. Two of the most common teaching practices that "teach to the test" are providing test-specific classwork and increasing the frequency with which students take practice tests. Whether such teaching practices improve student learning—both in terms of learning the content associated with a specific knowledge test as well as more general learning—is a largely unanswered question. To approach this question, this paper uses a student fixed effects approach to analyze the impact of these kinds of narrow teaching practices on student performance on a specific test as well as a general knowledge test. We find that test-specific classwork and practice tests with specific test items tend to have little or negative impacts on curriculum specific or general knowledge test performance, except for male students, and that subject practice tests (without emphasizing test-specific items) have positive effects on student outcomes on both kinds of tests, but larger on the curriculum-specific than on the general test, and much larger on the curriculum-specific test for male students. We discuss the logic for these results and what they tell us about the effectiveness of test-focused teaching practices more generally. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In educational contexts, tests not only assess what students know, they can also directly improve long-term retention of subject matter relative to restudying it. More importantly, the memorial advantage of testing is not limited to select information that was tested earlier. Research has shown that testing can serve as a versatile learning tool by enhancing the long-term retention of non-tested information that is conceptually related to previously tested information; stimulating the subsequent learning of new information; and permitting better transfer of learning to new knowledge domains. We further investigated the potential benefits of testing on learning by asking whether testing can also improve students’ learning and retention of the conceptual organization of study materials, and if so, whether processes involved in mentally organizing information during learning contribute to the memorial advantage of testing. In three experiments with categorized lists, we asked whether the testing effect in free recall is related to enhancements in organizational processing. In the first experiment, different groups of subjects studied a list either once or twice before a final criterial test or they studied the list once and took an initial recall test before the final test. Prior testing enhanced total recall of words and reduced false recall of extra-list intrusions relative to restudying. In addition, testing increased the number of categories accessed, the number of items recalled from within those categories, and improved category clustering. In two additional experiments, manipulating the organizational processing that occurred during initial study and test trials affected delayed recall and measures of output organization. Testing produced superior long-term retention when initial test conditions promoted the use of semantic relational information to guide episodic retrieval, and measures of category clustering and subjective organization were correlated with delayed recall. The results suggest that the benefit of testing in free recall learning arises, at least in part, because testing creates retrieval schemas based upon categorical knowledge and recollections of previous recall attempts that guide and facilitate episodic recall.

AB  - The article presents information on how the strategies of Littlejohn Elementary School principal Charlotte Kreuder helped teachers to make changes in instruction based on data analysis of students' test scores in Illinois. As a first step, she has started building on the 4,500-student DeKalb school district's efforts to implement a computerized testing system called the Benchmark Assessment System. The assessment system is produced by a division of Edison Schools Inc. With the system, students in 2nd grade and up take monthly math and reading tests that are aligned with the Illinois Standards Achievement Test, given every April.

AB  - Formative assessment (FA) has been a popular topic of study in education since the 1990s (Black & Wiliam, 1998a; 1998b). In China, the New English Curriculum for primary education in 2011 stressed the importance of FA in language classes (Ministry of Education, 2011). However, empirical studies investigating FA in China are generally lacking (Liu & Xu, 2017). My concern lies in the use and the impact of FA in English language learning in primary schools in China. In that context, this study seeks to identify and scrutinise effective FA strategies that can motivate learners and improve their achievement. The relevance of FA to English language learning lies in its interactive and dynamic approach, aimed at improving learners’ English by offering different strategies for enhancing learning. The FA strategies in my study include sharing learning aims, feedback, questioning, peer-assessment and self-assessment. They were selected from previous works on FA frameworks (Heritage, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Torrance & Pryor, 2001; Wiliam & Thompson, 2007). I summarised seven motivation theories and three motivation frameworks in language learning (Dörnyei, 1994; Williams & Burden, 1997; Dörnyei & Ottó, 1998) in order to draw up a new framework of motivation in language learning that can be applied in this study. Mixed methods were used. Data were gathered via quantitative questionnaires for learners exploring motivation, use of FA and attitudes towards FA; quantitative English language quizzes to measure student achievement during the fieldwork; and qualitative interviews with teachers and students regarding their perceptions of FA. Two teachers and 196 11-year-old students from four classes in Jiangsu Province in China took part in the study for two and a half months. The results showed that FA strategies have valuable application in this context notwithstanding the prevailing exam-oriented education culture in China. FA use was significantly positively correlated with students’ motivation and achievement, strikingly so in girls in the lower achievement bracket. There is a need for well differentiated FA due to the varied impact of FA strategies in different student groups. As a lighthouse, FA is not merely an assessment in class, but also a learning habit that guides both teacher and student in teaching and learning. With the findings, this thesis contributes an empirical research study in English of the impact of FA in an underrepresented education sector: primary education in China.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorEnglish testing is indispensable with English teaching and learning. They are so closely interrelated that one cannot do without the other. English testing plays a very important role in the process of English teaching and learning in China, and it is used as an effective assessment instrument for measuring and evaluating English teaching and learning. However, because too much attention has been paid to tests, many teachers and students 'teach for tests' and 'learn for tests'. Testing is not the ultimate aim of teaching and learning, but serves teaching and learning. However, testing can have direct influence on students' learning motivation and attitude as well as the way and content of teaching. If a test is a good one and can be applied properly, it can be positively beneficial. Otherwise, a test of bad qualities or misuse can be harmful and might become an impediment to language teaching and learning. Therefore, doing research on English testing is to develop tests with good qualities and to achieve beneficial backwash effects to facilitate English teaching and learning. High school English testing consists of various forms of tests: mid-term test, final test, placement test, classroom test, etc. And what is more, these tests are employed so frequently that students have found such terms as weekly tests, monthly tests, unit tests, etc. so familiar and so natural. However, the problem is whether the practice has brought about positive backwash effect on English teaching and helped to improve the latter. Based on the relationship between foreign language teaching and testing, the thesis mainly discusses and analyses the problem of high frequency of testing in high school English teaching process. The author starts with investigation and research on the current testing effect via questionnaires, interviews, teaching experiments, as well as consultation of available literature concerned, and tries to find out the factors that influence its effectiveness. Based on careful investigation and research, the author finds that instead of facilitating English teaching and learning, frequent testing has misled students to learn for tests, and produce more and more obvious negative effects as follows. By means of questionnaires, interviews, teaching practice and consultation of academic data, the author conducted the research on the effect of English tests in junior high school. A year-long investigation and study reveal that too frequent testing has a negative impact on English teaching in the schools, which can be observed in the following aspects. 1. In order to help students gain high scores in tests, the teachers use a training program dependant on to much testing. 2. Teachers' obsession with testing can interfere with their interaction with students in the class. 3. Too much testing obviously dictates how students use exercise materials of listening, speaking, reading and writing; in other words, students' exercises are decided by the content of testing. 4. Another effect of testing is the change of students' attitude toward learning before and after a test, i.e. their motivation and choice of activities for learning. Reflecting on the empirical study and the analysis, the writer concludes the research with some implications and suggestions for English teaching and learning, hoping that, under the guidance of testing and assessment theory, tests can be used properly in facilitating our English

AB  - Background: Assessment is an important issue in the education process that must be present in all stages of education, which include: initial assessment, formative assessment and final assessment. By selecting and adding virtual education learning tools and facilities to the teaching and learning process and turning it into an interactive and constructive educational activity, as well as using active learning environment design patterns such as 5E in schools, learning can be increased in students. Aims: The purpose of this research is to design a learning environment for virtual education based on creative methods of assessment and to determine its impact on the learning of second grade elementary school students. Methods: The current research design was carried out in two stages by using the combined or mixed research method. The first stage of the research was conducted using the content analysis method, using the literature of the virtual education learning environment based on the creative methods of measuring and learning students, along with the latest domestic and foreign written articles through databases. The second stage of the research was conducted using a quasi-experimental method in the form of a pre-test and post-test design with a control group. The statistical population of this research was elementary school students of Hefde district of Tehran. In this research, purposeful sampling was used. The sample of this research included sixth grade students of 17 Shahrivar primary school in the academic year of 1401-1402. The number of these students was 60, and in this research, they were randomly replaced in the test and control groups (30 people in each group). Results: The results show that the difference between the post-test scores in the two experimental and control groups is significant. The significance level of the findings is 95% confidence. In this research, creative and new measurement methods that have been less used so far were used in the design of the 5E learning environment and it was observed that these creative and new measurement methods have an effect on learning. Conclusion: Therefore, the design of the learning environment based on creative assessment methods has an effect on learning and its dimensions, including involvement, exploration, explanation, expansion of the subject and reporting of the students of the second year of elementary school.
